Lagertha: What are you two doing?
I'm taking Bjorn to the thing tomorrow.
Not yet. He's not old enough.
He's twelve years old.
Take him next year.
Next year is soon enough.
He'll need a silk ribbon, Lagertha.
You're a handsome boy.
Funny ears, though.
(Ragnar groans, satisfied)
Lagertha: Don't sleep with lots of women in Kattegat.
I can do without it for a few days.
Is that another way of saying you love me?
Huh?
I always dream of you.
Last night, I dreamt you were feeding me blood pudding.
What does that mean?
It means you're giving me your heart.
(Fire crackles)
Ragnar: (To Bjorn)
Get your dog, boy.
Bjorn: Frodi! Come on, boy.
<U+266A>
(Foliage crunches underfoot)
Bjorn: What will happen at the thing?
Ragnar: The Earl will deal with some criminal offences and then, we'll discuss the summer raids.
Bjorn: And where will you go?
Ragnar: The Earl decides.
He owns the ships.
He'll send us to the east, as always, to the baltic lands.
But I want to know what is to the west... what cities and gods are over there.
See, I'm not satisfied... With this.
Odin gave his eye to acquire knowledge, but I would give far more.
Bjorn: And will Earl Haraldson let you?
(Fire snaps and crackles)
Lagertha: Good.
Like this, nice and tight..
And on three.
One, two, three.
Very good, Gyda.
(Door bangs open)
Gyda, feed the goats.
Go on!
What do you want?
Man: We know you're all alone here.
All the men are gone.
If you're thirsty, I will give you a drink.
If you're hungry, I will feed you.
Otherwise, you must go.
Man 2: We will eat and drink after we've satisfied our other needs.
I don't want to kill you, woman.
You couldn't kill me if you tried for a hundred years.
(Loud metallic clank)
(Skin sizzles) Aggghhhhh!
(Yelps in pain and groans)
(Fighting grunts, weapons clank)
(Hook whooshes, man screams in pain)
Out!
(Relieved sigh)
Ragnar: I went to confess my love to her but I was set upon by a bear and an enormous hound who guarded her home.
I killed the bear with my spear and I managed to strangle the hound with my bare hands.
And that is how I gained her hand in marriage.
Did she tell you the same story?
Just about.
(Chuckles)
Are you ready to receive your arm ring and become a man?
Yes.
And what does a man do?
He fights.
Ragnar: And...?
He looks after his family.
Ragnar: That's right.
Could you look after our family?
What do you mean? You look after us.
Ragnar: Say I wasn't there.
I have a big decision to make.
It may change many things.
Now, go to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

Arrggghhh!
Bjorn!
So, here you are, brother.
Rollo.
Rollo: By Frey and all the Gods how you've grown.
Hello, Rollo.
Are you here for the thing?
You're a real man now.
Come, let's get a drink.
(Gulping greedily)
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.
Ragnar: Why don't you go lie down, hmm?
Rollo: So where do you think the Earl is going to send us this year?
Those bastards to the east are as poor as we are.
Ragnar: I know.
That's why we should sail west.
I've heard such tales, rollo.
Great towns, and cities, and treasures; Hordes of gold and silver, and... and a new God.
I've heard those stories too.
But what does it mean?
We can't sail across an open ocean.
I believe there's a way to go west.
I have something that will change everything.
What?
What is that?
Now just listen.
A while back, I met someone, a wanderer.
He told me that it was possible to go west, over the open sea, using this.
It's a sun-board.
It needs to sit in water.
Another wanderer?
This time is different.
Rollo: Now tell me, Ragnar, this-this wanderer of yours, has he ever sailed west himself?
Just get some water.
(Sighs heavily)
(Water pours and sloshes in bowl)
Ragnar: Now, this candle is the sun.
Every day...
The sun rises up into the sky until noon.
See how the shadow shortens?
At noon, it is at its shortest.
Rollo: That only tells me how far South I have travelled.
Didn't I just tell you to listen?!
The day before sailing you mark a circle around the pointer where the shadow is at its shortest at noon.
The next day at sea, you place the board back into water around noon and watch the shadow.
If the shadow only touches the circle...
Your course remains true?
Yes.
And if it passes outside the circle, like this...
Rollo: Then you have drifted and you must steer further South.
Yes.
And what if it never reaches the circle?
Rollo: Then you are too far South and must steer more to the north.
Ragnar: That's it!
Keep the noon shadow on the circle and your course will be true, west.
(Flame hisses)
But what if there is no sun, hmm?
How can the board help you then?
How could you find your way?
Using this.
Follow me outside.
(Door creaks open)
They call it a sun-stone.
Oh! You see?
There is the sun.
Now we go west.
Come on. (Sheep bleat) Come on.
(Loud buzz of chatter, man clucks like a chicken)
(Clapping)
(Man clucks)
(Clapping, cheering, and laughing)
Man: Silence! (Bangs staff)
Silence! (Banging staff)
(Everyone quiets down)
Svein: Olaf Anwend.
You have pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing.
Tomorrow, you will run a gauntlet of stones and turf as punishment.
Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.
Svein: Let it be known a fine is to be paid by anyone who fails to throw something.
(Crowd laughs)
Svein: Bring in the next accused.
Men: There he is! Murderer!
(People shout angrily)
Svein: Eric Trygvasson, you are accused of the murder of Sigvald strut this January.
How do you plead?
Trygvasson: It wasn't murder, lord.
I killed him in self-defense.
Woman: (Shouting) Liar!
Crowd: (Angry shouting)
Svein: If it wasn't murder, why did you not declare your crime to the first person that you met afterwards, as the law obliges?
In fact, you passed by several houses before you reported it.
Trygvasson: I thought the relatives of the dead man might be living in them.
(Crowd murmurs, disbelieving)
Svein: The law allows you to pass two houses in such circumstances, but never a third.
Family member: You murdered my brother in cold blood!
Trygvasson: It's not true!
We argued about some disputed land.
He pulled out a knife.
Family member: You wanted that land for yourself!
You're a liar and a coward.
Trygvasson: Who says I'm a coward? I'm not a coward!
(Crowd erupts, shouting)
Silence!
As the normal procedures were not followed, this killing cannot be atoned for by compensating the victim's family.
Murder is a dishonorable deed amongst our people.
Carried out in secret, unacknowledged, and likely to give rise to a series of revenge killings that would involve your own family.
Lord, you knew about that land.
You knew I had a claim to it...
Enough!
I ask you to look to the accused.
If you think that he is guilty, raise your arms.
The decision must be unanimous.
Eric Trygvasson, you have been found guilty of murder.
Man: Yes! Justice!
How do you wish to die?
By beheading, lord.
Earl Haraldson: Your wish is granted.
You shall be executed tomorrow.
After which we will shall feast and talk about the summer raids.
(Crowd cheers and claps)
(Crowd jeers loudly)
(Grunts)
You have to.
(Jeering loudly)
(Hard whack)
Woman: Yeah! Yeah!
(Jeering loudly)
(Laughing)
(Pained grunts)
(Water splashes)
(Crowd cheers and laughs)
(Crowd quiets down)
Bjorn: Why is he smiling, father?
Ragnar: He wants to die well, without fear, to atone for his sins.
You must watch, for his sake.
Rollo: It's his only hope of reaching Valhalla.
(Axe slices soundly, crowd cheers and applauds)
(Crowd cheers and applauds)
Earl Haraldson: Feed him to your pigs!
(Crowd quiets down)
And I curse him.
May he never enter Valhalla.
May he never feast with the gods.
(Crowd murmurs, shocked)
Why did he do that?
Ragnar: He should not have done that.
Rollo: Someone told me he wanted that land for himself and he knew Trygvasson had the best claim to it, but refused to sell it.
You hear that, boy?
This how things are done around here.
On: Olaf, son of Ingolf, Bjorn, son of Ragnar.
May you accept this gift of salt and earth to remind yourself that you belong to both the land and the sea.
These arm rings bind you in loyalty to me, your lord, your chieftain.
Any oath that you swear on these rings must be honored and kept.
Do you understand and swear to this?
Boys: Yes, lord.
Earl Haraldson: And do you freely give your fealty to me, your lord, your chieftain?
Boys: Yes, lord.
Earl Haraldson: Good.
You may put on the arm rings.
Chieftain's wife: Come here.
(Chuckles)
Man: Wooooo!
(Crowd cheers and applauds)

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Earl Haraldson: (Sword clanks) Let us feast!
Ragnar: My lord, we all want to feast, but we also want to know where we will be raiding this summer.
(Murmurs of agreement)
Can't it wait, Ragnar?
Rollo: No. Tell us.
We want to know.
We have a right to know.
Earl Haraldson: Very well.
We will raid east again, to the Eastlands, and into Russia.
Ragnar: Every year we go to the same places!
But there is an alternative...
(Quiet murmuring)
If you choose.
Earl Haraldson: Oh yes, yes. Choice, yes.
I have heard of these rumors, these stories; That if we travel west, that we will somehow reach a land that is rich and plentiful.
(Crowd laughs)
But I tell you that I will not risk my ships or my reputation on such a deluded fantasy.
They are my ships -
I pay for them... and they go where I tell them to go.
Now that's the end of the matter.
Let's feast!
(Crowd cheers and applauds)
Ragnar: Let me see!
It's a fine ring.
Housecarl: Ragnar Lothbrok, Earl Haraldson wants to speak with you...
in private.
Ragnar: Stay with your Uncle.
Ragnar Lothbrok...
Sit down.
Are you hungry?
Yes, lord.
You want to feast in my hall?
You want to sail in my ships?
Anything else you want from me?
Lord...
Earl Haraldson: You keep talking about the west... what do you know of it, hmm?
Why are you so certain that it's a land of great riches, hmm?
Ragnar: I can't be sure.
But I believe that...
I don't care what you believe.
You insulted me out there, and not for the first time, but, believe me, it will be the last.
Svein: Who told you you could go?
You are a farmer.
You should be content with your lot.
Farms are few and in great demand, and there are many people here who would like to possess your land.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I understand.
Then don't ever stick your nose in my face again.
I don't trust him. Watch him.
(Panting)
Earl Haraldson: Where are they?
Where are my sons?
You said you'd found them.
(Cries out in grief and pain)
(Gasps awake, tries to catch his breath)
(Sighs)
Bjorn: Where are we going now? I'm so tired.
Ragnar: To talk to the gods.
It's what we do.
Seer: Why don't you come in? I'm waiting.
Sit.
Ancient seer: What do you want?
Ragnar: I want to know what the gods have in store.
Ancient seer: For you...
Or for the boy?
I'm more interested in myself.
The gods desire you to have a great future.
I see that.
But they can withdraw their goodwill at any time.
Ragnar: To have this great future, must I challenge the law?
Ancient seer: You must convince the gods to alter the runes so they work in your favor.
But the laws of men are far below the workings and shapings of the gods.
So I should take the laws of men into my own hands?
Answer me.
You already have your answer.
No I don't.
Ancient seer: Well, then go and ask the gods yourself.
What are you afraid of?
Ragnar: Wait outside.
Bjorn: All right.
You haven't helped me at all, ancient one.
Perhaps you asked the wrong questions.
(Wind gusts)
(Rain patters lightly)
Ragnar: We have someone special to visit.
His name is Floki.
Bjorn: Floki?
Like Loki the God?
Ragnar: Yes, only different.
How is he different?
He's not a God.
Why didn't he come to the Thing?
Because...
Because he's shy.
(Man shrieks and laughs)
Ragnar: Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.
Floki: Hello.
How are you?
Well. Thank you, sir.
Let me see.
Ah!
You have your father's eyes...
Unfortunately.
Ragnar: Why unfortunately?
It means he will be like you, and therefore he will want to do better than you, and you will hate him for it.
(Laughs)
Bjorn: How can you tell that by just looking at my face?
Oh, it's the same with trees.
I can tell which trees will make the best planks just by looking at them.
I can look inside the tree.
Ragnar: Floki is a boat-builder...
Among other things.
(Laughs)
(Woodpecker pecks nearby)
Hmm...
This is one.
Inside this tree are two almost perfect planks.
They will bend, then curve, like a woman's body from the thighs to the back.
When I split this tree I will find them.
You can see that?
Do you think I'm joking?
I joke about many things, son of Ragnar, but never about ship-building.
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?
Ragnar: So... what about our boat?
(Waterfall roars)
Floki: It will be lighter and carry a bigger sail.
The construction is different.
It's built with a strong central plank.
The two strakes above it are nailed directly onto the knees of the frame.
But the ones below - look!... are cleated and lashed onto the frames, not nailed, so they can move in relation to each other.
This means the boat won't butt against the waves like a goat, but move over them like a ripple.
Hmm.
Ragnar: The hull is deeper. How will my men set their oars?
Floki: I will cut them into the sheerstrakes, and the ports can be closed when the boat is at sea.
And you think it could handle long sea voyages?
Floki: (Laughs) That's why I'm building it.
But will it be strong enough?
We won't know that until we try.
Ragnar: For the anchor.
It's all I have left from last summer's raids.
Don't worry.
We'll soon be as rich as dwarves!
(Chuckles)
I missed you.
Did anything happen while we were away?
No.
Ragnar: Hmm.
(Sighs heavily)
(Laughs) Did you miss me?
I ached with love longing.
My belly was empty of laughter.
Is that what you want? Hmm?
You want me to make you laugh?
I don't want to laugh now.
I want to ride you, like a bull.
Like a wild bull.
(Moaning)
(Water laps at the shore)
(Water splashes as rollo trudges to shore)
(Sighs)
Hello, young Bjorn.
Hello, rollo.
Where are your parents?
They are having s*x.
(Chuckles) Well, uh...
I guess we'll have to wait.
So, Gyda, is your mother teaching you how to use a shield?
Yes, I know how to use a shield.
Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.
Lagertha: Was?
Rollo: Is a famous shield-maiden.
Lagertha: Come on, children, to bed.
Gyda: Do I have to?
Let's leave the men.
Bjorn: But I'm a man. I have a ring.
Ragnar: Let him stay awhile.
To bed!
Say good night.
Good night, my children.
(Children bid good night to Ragnar and rollo)
Good night.
Ragnar: Hey!
(Playfully) Shhhaaaaaa!
(Laughs)
Tell me your news.
What about the boat?
It's nearly ready.
I won't go under your command.
I won't go unless we're all equal.
Ragnar: We are brothers.
You and I will always be equal.
Then we must find a crew.
Not many men will go against the wishes of Haraldson.
Many will be afraid, some may even go to him and betray us.
I must go piss.
(Water laps at the shore)
(Sighs)
(Water pours)
Rollo: Yesterday, I was with a girl from the town.
Thank you.
A good-looking girl too.
But when she shouted out in pleasure, I didn't see her face, I saw yours.
Lagertha...
Don't talk like that.
Rollo: Why not?
I think about you all the time.
That's too bad.
Rollo: Don't insult me, shield-maiden.
No.
I would never insult you.
You're too great a warrior...
But perhaps not so great a man.
(Waves lap at the shore, raven caws)
(Waves lap at the shore)
(Wings beat loudly)
(Ravens caw in the distance)
(Raven caws echo loudly)
(Door bursts open)
Ragnar: I saw something.
What did you see?
(Exhales)
A sign.
It made me certain we're doing the right thing.
Good night, brother.
(Bird chirps in the distance)
(Waves lap against the ship)
(Water churns as they row)
(Grunts of effort)
Ragnar: Set the sail.
Floki! The sail!
She'll sink.
Ragnar: No she bloody won't!
Floki: I shouldn't have pretended to build such a boat.
It's beyond my humble capabilities.
(Oar thumps) I'll set the sail.
Floki: I'm sorry, Ragnar.
I've wasted all your money. It was all a joke.
Ragnar: Shut up, man.
(Sail unfurls)
(Wind gusts strongly)
(Sail snaps open, catching the wind)
Ha!
Now it runs on its cool keel.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Why didn't you believe me?
I told you I could do it!
(Ragnar and Floki laugh)
Ah?
Now it's all up to you, Ragnar Lothbrok.

Ragnar: Erik.
Erik: Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome to my house.
You also, rollo.
I've done as you asked, Ragnar, and sought out these young men to meet you.
All of them have sworn upon their rings to keep this meeting a secret.
You have done well, my friend, although I knew I could trust you.
Leif: What are we here for?
You are here, firstly, because you have nothing better to do.
(Laughing and protesting)
Ragnar: See, all you lot live idle and wasted lives.
(Young men protest, upset)
Listen to him!
(Everyone quiets down)
We have built a new boat.
And with this boat, for the first time, we can go west.
(Men scoff, chuckle)
Ragnar: Across the great sea, to a place called England, where countless riches await us.
Torstein: How would we steer across the open sea?
(Men laugh)
We have discovered a way.
Kauko: You want us to join you in the boat?
Rollo: Yes, we do.
And I have Ragnar's word that we will all be equal and share equally the spoils of our raid.
Knut: If there are any.
(Murmurs of agreement)
What is your name?
Knut.
I promise you, Knut, I've heard witnesses.
Just stories.
Just stories...
(Chuckles softly)
Just stories.
All things begin and end as stories.
Erik: We have to remember, though, that Earl Haraldson has ordered us to sail east.
The Earl knows nothing about our new boat.
He knows nothing about the new way of navigating.
This is why he refuses to let us go west.
Leif: He could kill us for disobeying his orders.
(Murmurs of agreement)
Yes, he could.
We can offer you a chance to shine in battle and impress the gods, and to bring back such plunder that you have never seen before.
Have you got the balls to join us?
I'll go.
Man: And I. Man 2: I will go.
Young men: I too! I will too! And I! I will go!
What about you, Knut?
Are you coming?
Yes, I want a good story to tell my children.

Prepare to leave in the next few weeks, and tell no one that doesn't need to know.

Svein: Good throw. Siggy: (Laughs)
Svein: Well played.
Earl Haraldson: Well?
Olafur: My lord, there was a meeting.
Earl Haraldson: Where?
In the house of Erik Marteinn.
Was Ragnar Lothbrok there?
Yes, lord.
Shall we show them the axe?
Nothing would please me more, but it's too soon.
We need to watch and wait.
Siggy: Only good things come from watching...
And waiting.
(Quietly)
Were you looking at my wife?
Have you slept with her?
No, lord!
I swear on all the gods.
If she wants to sleep with you, then I give my permission.
It will be arranged.
(Hooves thud)
(Birds cry overhead)
(Water splashes)
Lagertha: So when do we sail?
Ragnar: I already told you.
I don't want you to come.
Why not?
Ragnar: I need to leave the children and the farm in the hands of someone I trust.
What if the Earl finds out we have gone without his permission?
He might try and claim our family home.
This was going to be the most exciting voyage of our lives.
(Ragnar continues washing clothes)
To go west!
I have dreamed of it many times, and in my dreams we are always together.
What if there is no west?
This is the most dangerous and stupid voyage ever.
What if we both die, hmm?
Then who would take care of the children... rollo?!
You have no right to say that!
All right, all right. You go.
You go and I shall stay here and look after the children.

Olafur surprised me.
I didn't think, out of all of them, he would behave like that.
A man lives or dies by his honor.
Siggy: That's true.
He thought so little of mine that he really believed that I would give you to him.
(Laughs)
Honor is a rare commodity these days.
Yes.
Almost as rare as those in whom I can trust.
It's true, my love, our enemies are everywhere.
Everywhere?
They cannot prevail.
They cannot prevail.

Rollo.
(Raven cries)
Where is my anchor?
It was promised for today.
Maybe your blacksmith is a liar.
Floki: I don't think so.
This hair is from his daughter's head.
I promised him that if he went to Earl Haraldson I would find a way to kill her.
(Laughs)
Ragnar: I still don't see Knut.
Well, that's because he isn't here.
He hasn't sent word either.
That troubles me.
We live in a sea of troubles.
But look, some are ended.
(Cart rattles)

And this is mine.

Svein: Come.
Well?
They have set sail.
Good.
They'll never be heard from again.
But...
But what?
What if Ragnar is right?
There are no lands to the west!
Get out.
Rollo: It's noon.
Let's look at the board.
Ragnar: Get the bucket.
Not too far South.
Nor too far north.
(Ragnar chuckles)
The board works.
How do we know?
(Ragnar laughs, excitedly)
(Fire crackles)
Lagertha: The great sea is held in place by Jormungand, the serpent, whose giant body encircles it and who keeps his tail in his mouth to complete the circle and stop the waves breaking loose.
But one day, the God Thor, son of earth, was fishing in the sea for the serpent, using a bull's head for bait.
Jormungand reared up and the waves pummeled the shore as he twisted and writhed in a fury.
(Sea churns)
They were well matched, serpent and God, in that furious fight.
The seas boiled around them, but then the hook became dislodged, and the serpent slithered free and sank again, so quickly, beneath the waves.
And soon, the sea was calm once more, as if nothing had disturbed it.
(Loud crack of thunder)
Rollo: Thor.
Ragnar: Storm's coming.
Should we let down the sail?
Floki, should we let down the sail?
Yes, we have to take the sail down, and then we must row.
If we are not moving forward, then we will be soaked by the waves and sink.
Erik: Ready?
Man: Keep her straight!
Ragnar: You heard him!
(Grunts of effort)
(Waves crash and batter the ship)
Ragnar: Tent!
(Huge wave splashes)
Rollo: Shove the oars!
Row!
Row!
(Loud crack of thunder)
(Thunder rumbles ominously in the distance)
(Loud crack of thunder)
(Murmurs of concern)
(Loud crack of thunder)
Ragnar: Are you afraid?
Floki yes, Ragnar Lothbrok, I am afraid.
But not for me.
I am afraid for my boat.
(Thunder booms loudly)
Rollo: Thor is striking his anvil.
He is angry with us.
He wants to sink us.
(Thunder booms)
Floki: It's true!
Thor is beating his hammer.
The lightning is the sparks from his anvil.
But he's not angry with us.
I understand now.
Why should he be angry with us?
Why should he want to sink our boat?
Don't you understand? He is celebrating.
He is full of good news.
He wants to show everybody that he can't sink this boat.
He loves this boat!
Man: Sit down, you idiot!
It's my boat, and the gods love my boat.
(Wave crashes) Why should I...
Not be happy?!
Ragnar: Floki, sit down.
Remember, you can't swim!
(Laughing hysterically)
(Lightning fizzes, crackles, and rips across the dark sky)

Athelstan: Father Cuthbert!
What is it, brother Athelstan?
We can all see the signs.
Father Cuthbert: Signs? What signs? Of what do you speak?
You know as well as we that judgment day is at hand.
Jeremiah says so!
\"And on that day, the sun shall be darkened,\"
and the moon shall not give her light, \"and the stars of heaven shall fall.\"
In the name of God, that is enough.
But it's true!
\"And I stood upon the sand of the sea,\"
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, \"having seven heads and ten horns.\"
Father Cuthbert: (Firmly) I will hear no more!
You will return to your dormitory and pray to God for forgiveness and humility...
And when the storm has passed all shall be well.
You will do as I order.
Yes, father.

Blacksmith's daughter: Father!
Good day to you, blacksmith.
(Steam hisses)
Blacksmith: My lord, how can I be of use to you?
You make anchors, don't you?
Yes, lord.
Have you made any recently?
No, not recently, lord Haraldson.
Svein: You didn't forge an anchor for a man called Ragnar Lothbrok?
I would have remembered.
Don't hurt my daughter.
Why would I hurt your daughter?
His lordship just wants to know the truth.
Did you forge the anchor for Ragnar Lothbrok's ship?
Yes, I forged it.
Let go of her.
Put down your hammer.
I promise you no harm will come to your daughter.
Look in the flames.
The sages say that we can see our future in the flames.
(Struggling grunts)

We are not sailing towards any new country but just into an empty ocean...
Utterly and completely lost.
Kauko, leif...
We have been persuaded by madmen and fools.
The God loki is behind this voyage.
That scoundrel, that sly one.
Trouble and suffering are meat and drink to him.
Shut up, man!
Warrior: No!
No.
If anyone is mad, it is you.
I'm not the one who convinced all these good men to sacrifice their lives for a dream, an illusion.
It wasn't me who joined forces with the sly one to get us to sail west, into nothing, into nowhere.
Man: He's mad!
Man: Don't tempt the gods!
Oh, and here we are, lost, certain to die.
For what?
Sit down and shut up.
You sound like the sly one.
Perhaps you are the God of mischief who sends men mad, and sends them to their deaths.
Man: Sit down!
I curse the day I ever agreed to come with you, Ragnar Lothbrok.
For this ship is cursed, and we are...

Leif: I don't understand.
Why do they leave such treasures unprotected?
Is there some spell, some magic which protects them?
Erik: It appears not.
(They laugh)
Ragnar: Perhaps they think their God protects them.
If this is their God, then he's dead.
He is nailed to a cross.
Leif: He cannot protect anyone.
He is not alive, like Odin, Thor or Frey.
What use is he then?
(Leif and Erik laugh)
(Clank nearby)
(Frightened gasps)
Athelstan: (ln old Norse) Don't kill me.
Ragnar: You speak our language.
(Gasps, frightened)
Ragnar: How do you speak our language?
I've travelled.
We are told to travel, to take the word of God.
Please, don't kill me.
Ragnar: What is that you have in your hand?
(Shakily) A book...
The gospels of st John, I... I wanted to save it.
(Flips through pages)
(Snaps book shut)
Ragnar: Of all the treasures I see in this place, you chose to save this?
Yes.
Hmm. Why?
Why?
Because without the word of God there is only darkness.
Rollo: This is a strange place indeed.
We have been everywhere and we have found no women.
Just these strange men.
Ragnar: I believe they are the priests of their God.
Rollo: Take what you will.
This is what we came for.
Why have you not killed this one?
He is worth more alive... to sell as a slave.
I would kill him.
We have no room left on the boat.
Ragnar: I forbid it.
Rollo: How can you forbid it, little brother?
We are all equals, and I say he dies.
Does it really mean that much to you, brother?

Hello!
You are Ragnar Lothbrok's son, Bjorn.
I remember you from the thing.
Yes.
Where is your father?
Lagertha: Bjorn? Who are you talking to?
Svein: I was just asking your son where Ragnar Lothbrok might be?
He's gone fishing.
Svein: Oh! Fishing.
He's gone fishing.
Yes, fishing.
When will he return?
I don't know.
Svein: In which case I must take someone back as surety, just in case.
In case...?
In case your husband has not gone fishing!
You! Come!
Come!
You have to come with me.
If you don't obey this order, the Earl will never give you an arm-ring!
I'll come.
Svein: Good.
Then let's be on our way.
Ingigerd: What are you doing? Where are you taking my son?
Svein: He'll be quite safe, woman.
I bid you all a good day.
(Gulls cry)
Ragnar: (Quietly) We did it, brother.
Yes, brother, we did.
Let's just hope the Earl sees it that way.
Yeah.
What is your name?
Athelstan.
I am Ragnar Lothbrok.
What was that place called?
Lindisfarne.
England?
Yes.
It was foretold that divine punishment would fall upon God's chosen people for all our grievous sins, and so it has happened.
And that is why I am here.
(Chuckles) No.
You are here because I spared your life.
Why did you spare my life?
I don't know yet.
(Birds chirp)
(Low hum of chatter)
(Waterfalls thunder)
(Horn bellows)
(Low hum of chatter)
Athelstan: Ragnar Lothbrok!
What is it?
Brother Cenwulf here, beside me, I think he's dead.
Ragnar: You're right.
Leif.
(Body splashes, water bubbles)
(Frightened sobs)
(Chuckles)
May God rest your soul, brother Cenwulf.
E nomine patri, e filii, et spiritus sancti. Amen.
Yeah!
(Crowing victoriously)

(Loud buzz of excited chatter)

We'll drink well tonight, my friend.
Ahhh.
Ellisef: Erik!
Oh, thank the gods!
Erik: And not alone! Look!
We've brought slaves to sell.
But there's more, woman.
More things of gold and silver than you and I have ever seen before, nor anyone else here in Kattegat.
(Loud buzz of chatter)
Man: Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome back.
We know you sailed west across the open ocean and found land and plunder, as you promised.
So let no man say any more that it is not possible, and we salute and praise you.
(Crowd cheers)
(Horn bellows)
Knut. You're too late.
You missed the boat.
I came to tell you that Earl Haraldson summons you to attend him in the great hall.
It will be a pleasure.
Man: Well done, Ragnar!
Ragnar: Are you coming, Knut?
(Crowd cheers)
(Excited chatter)
Ragnar: My lord, it was easy to take all of these things.
The priests in their temple, they had no weapons.
They were like babies.
Here is one of their priests.
We captured several of them to sell for slaves.
It must be true that there are many more such holy places in england and other lands to the west likewise filled with such treasure, and to sail there will benefit us all.
(Excited murmurs)
Earl Haraldson: How did you find this place of great riches when all before you had failed?
My lord, we were more fortunate than others.
We had Thor on our side.
Crowd: Thor. Thor. Thor.
(Snorts) Yes.
Then you were indeed fortunate.
But you understand that all this belongs to me, by right.
Ragnar: My lord, me and Floki paid for the boat.
Surely we are entitled to... some reward, and my crew...
Earl Haraldson: You want me to pay you when you took these things as easily as from babies?
(Crowd laughs)
Earl Haraldson: Here's what I've decided to do...
(Doors open)
Each one of you can take one thing from this haul.
One?
Earl Haraldson: Yes. And you'll still be richer than you were before.
Now, all the world can see how magnanimous and generous is your lord, especially since you disobeyed me.
So, Ragnar Lothbrok, what will you choose?
(Crowd laughs)
Ragnar: I will take the priest for my slave.
The priest?
(Siggy laughs out loud and everyone joins in)
Granted.
Rollo: Why did you do that?
Why did you give everything away so easily?
We wasted our time.
I never should have believed in you.
Ragnar: He was looking for an excuse to kill us.
Why would we go to Valhalla after such miserable and pointless deaths?
Brother, believe me, this is not the end, it's just the beginning.
Well...
At least we didn't give everything away so easily.
That's your one thing?
How should he ever find out?
You idiot!
Would odin expect us to do anything so stupid?
Rollo: You have your odin and I have mine.
Ragnar: Why don't you go get drunk, spend all this on whores.
Make sure the Earl really finds out that you stole from him.
(Silver clinks)
(Jewels jingle)
What a hoard is this!
What a hoard it is.
Siggy: See what you've done, my lord?
Never doubt your power.
With just a few words, you stripped Ragnar Lothbrok of all his treasure.
He's nothing to you, and you are all power, all authority.
You can have whatever you want.
(Heavy, passionate breathing)
(Dog barks, goats bleat)
(Chickens cluck)
(Clucking) (Startled gasp)
Gyda: They told me you'd come home!
Bjorn: Father! You're home!
Ragnar: Little man...
Bjorn: Did you reach the west?
So...
Where's all the treasure you promised?
The Earl took it all for himself.
But I found it, and it filled the boat.
(Laughs)
I believe you.
You ought to believe me.
This is a priest from the temple to prove it.
Priest! This is my family.
His name is Athelstan.
Although he's a foreigner, he speaks our language, don't you?
A little, yes.
Bjorn: What is wrong with your head?
When we become monks, they cut our hair.
It marks us out.
Gyda: If you're a priest, which God do you like best?
There is only one God.
Ragnar: Here, you can touch him.
Bjorn: Are we keeping him?
Gyda: Hello.
I've missed your smell and your body.
Bjorn: Why do you wear this?
Athelstan: All monks do.
(Playful giggling)
Bjorn: Look at his feet.
(Heavy breathing)
(Athelstan quietly reads aloud)
(Heavy breathing, thumping)
(Quietly reading aloud)
Ragnar: (Whispering) Athelstan.
Athelstan, we want to ask you something.
Come and join us, priest.
Ragnar: Come on.
Don't you want to?
You'll enjoy it.
I am a monk.
I have taken vows of celibacy.
I cannot touch a woman.
I never have.
Wouldn't you like to?
It would be a sin.
Who would know?
God would know.
Lagertha: What if he looked the other way?
(Murmurs a prayer)
Go to sleep then... with your God.

Svein: Come.
(Treasure clatters and clinks)
Why are you burying all this treasure?
Don't you know anything, boy?
Svein: Odin promises that a man will have the use of everything he has hoarded up after he is dead and wakes up again in Valhalla.

I am very curious about england.
Does it have one king who rules over the whole country?
(Drunken laugh)
There are four kingdoms with four kings.
You landed in the kingdom of Northumbria.
The king of Northumbria is called Aelle.
He is a great king.
A powerful king.
Then why did his men not protect your temple?
(Chuckles)
Before you came, we had no need to protect our monastery.
We lived in peace.
Everyone respected it as a place of God.
Why does your God need silver and gold, hmm?
He must be greedy... (Laughs)
Like loki!
We have greedy gods too.
My God is not greedy.
His kingdom is not of this world.
Then why is his kingdom so full of treasure?
Christian people give away their riches to the churches and monasteries in order to save their souls.
What are their souls?
(Fire crackles)

Earl Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok.
My lord.
And how do you find your new slave?
Hmm...
I find him very useful, as you will discover.
So what do you want?
Ragnar: I want to sail west again.
I have spoken at great lengths with my Christian slave.
He is not a stupid person, however stupid his God is.
He has traveled a great deal, and he has told me that there are many countries to the west.
He has also told me about his england, about his kings and his customs.
Earl Haraldson: And what are we to do with his customs?
Ragnar: He has informed me of a large town, near to the temple that we raided before.
And in this town there are other temples, and surely other riches.
Athelstan: No! I was lying! There's nothing there!
Ragnar: Shhh!
You see?
This town is clearly worth a visit.
Give us back our boat.
Let us go there and find out.
What do you have to lose?
Any plunder we take will be yours to do with as you please.
Earl Haraldson: I could go there myself.
Ragnar yes, you could, my lord, but why put yourself in danger?
Why not leave it to someone who has more... experience of this journey, and someone who is more expendable?
(Coins clink)
Very well.
I sanction this raid... on one condition: A warrior I trust goes with you.
Knut.
You will go with him for my sake.
Knut: Trust me, lord.
I will take very close care of your interests.
Athelstan: O lord, forgive me for what I have done.
You will not regret this.
He's found a new way to navigate the sea.
Find out what it is.
(Townspeople chatter)

Ragnar: Run away if you want.
(Dog barks in distance)

Ragnar: I have the Earl's permission to sail back to england.
I want to leave as soon as possible.
How soon is that?
Ragnar: Tomorrow.
(Sighs) We all wish you success.
We will sacrifice to odin.
Are you not coming?
What?
I want you to come with me.
But the farm, the children.
Bjorn is still too young, although he can help on the farm.
But who is to be in charge?
Ragnar: The priest.
I will leave him with a key.
Father! You cannot place a slave above me, your natural son.
Ragnar: I don't regard him as a slave.
He's a responsible person.
Please, Ragnar Lothbrok, don't do this.
What do you think, Gyda?
Gyda: I don't mind. I like the priest.
Ragnar: (Smiles) Hmm...
Then it is decided.
If any harm befalls my children, I will tear the lungs out of your body, priest.

Oof! Agh

Rollo: Answer me this, Knut: Are you really with us?
Understand this!
A war band lives...
And dies together.
If you cannot trust the men to either side of you, or in front of you, you are already a dead man.
Knut: I am with you.
I made a mistake before I did not come with you.
Now I fear odin will make a bad judgment of me.
For me, that's as important as it is for you.

We did it, brother.
Rollo: Let's just hope the Earl sees it that way.
Earl Haraldson: Do you understand that all this belongs to me?
Rollo: Why did you give everything away so easily?
Ragnar: Believe me, this is not the end.
Here is a priest of the temple.
His name is Athelstan
. He speaks our language.
I want to sail west again.
Earl Haraldson: On one condition: A warrior I trust goes with you.
Knut: I will take very close care of your interests.
Ragnar: I want to leave as soon as possible.
I'll leave the priest with a key.
You cannot place a slave above me!

Then surprise is our biggest advantage.
Ragnar: Arne, what day is it today?
Saturday.
Then we attack tomorrow.
Why?
(Steely) You will understand tomorrow.
King Aelle: Who were these strangers?
Saxon 2: I cannot say.
Their ship was sighted sailing up the coast.
It was a ship unlike any other.
They were not Franks, then?
Saxon 2: No. They looked very different, and used axes.
Most were as tall as giants.
Noble 2: Sire, I fear that these raiders are the same pagans who attacked the monastery at Lindisfarne.
It is the letter that Abbot Alcuin wrote to you of those terrible events.
King Aelle: \"They came to the church at Lindisfarne\", laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy place with polluted steps, dug up the altars and seized all the treasure of the holy church.
They killed some of the brothers, took some away with them in fetters, \"some they drowned in the sea.\"
Where do they come from, these pagans?
Some say from the north.
Well, wherever they come from, they are not welcome in my kingdom.
Floki: (Startled grunt)
(Men laugh)
(Blade rings as it's sharpened)
Take care today.
Don't take any foolish risks and don't get separated from the others.
I was just going to say the same thing to you, my love.
Enough of that talk.
It's getting light and we've wasted too much time already.
We must wait a little longer.
Leif: Wait? What for?
Ragnar: Just wait!

King Aelle: How could this happen, my lord Wigea?
Wigea: Sire, I have never in my life seen men fight as these northmen fight.
Believe me, there's something devilish in the way they look, in their lack of fear in the face of death.
King Aelle: My lord, that is just a counsel of despair.
Are these pagans not men, like we are?
Do they not bleed when they are cut?
Or do they have wings and tongues of fire?
No, sire.
Who are they?
We captured two of them, who were guarding their boat.
We couldn't understand anything they said at all, except one word: Ragnar.
Ragnar.
(Wind gusts, fire crackles)
(Vikings murmur quietly)
Rollo: Death is on its way to take Kauko.
Don't grieve for him. Don't pity him.
Guess where he is now?
The valkyries are taking him home to Valhalla.
Right at this moment he is...
He is drinking ale with the gods.
Yes, he is happier than even we are, with our boat and... these goods.
Erik: Even so, he was my kinsman.
We must avenge his death.
It was done in the name of king Aelle, and king Aelle must suffer for it.
One day, he will...
If the gods will it.
(Saxon prisoner whimpers)
Look at him, he's wetting himself.
You kept your word.
You took us to the town, and I thank you for that.
Drink.
You want to live?
(Saxon prisoner gulps)
(Prisoner grunts)
(Hard whack) Ungh!
Bjorn: I want to go to Kattegat.
I want to see my father return soon.
He must return soon.
I gave your father my word that I would look after you both here.
You are not looking after us.
We look after ourselves.
I cannot allow you to go on your own to Kattegat.
Your father would never tolerate such a thing.
Bjorn: Then we should go together, the three of us.
Athelstan: And who will then look after the farm?
For what we are about to receive, may the lord make us truly grateful.
Amen.
(Ale splashes into cup)
Gyda: Can I have some ale?
You're too young, Gyda, to drink ale.
I want to make a sacrifice to Thor, for my father's safe return.
What will you sacrifice?
You!
(Cup and bowl crash on the floor)
(Rough, scratchy rasp)
Athelstan: (Very quietly)
Where are you, lord?
Tell me: Is it your will that I am here with these heathens?
(Wind howls outside)
How does it serve you?
I don't understand.
And for the first time in my life I am angry with you.
You allow my brothers to be slaughtered and sold.
Is this really your will?
For the first time...
I feel lonely.
Where are you, lord?
Where are you?
And why don't you answer me?
(Strange rustling and shaking of feathers)
It's just an owl.
Bjorn.
Bjorn, wake up.
(Exasperated groan) What is it?
We'll go to Kattegat all of us, tomorrow.
(Seabird cries)
Warrior: Kattegat!

Women and children: (Chatter excitedly)

Earl Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok, my friend, how was your voyage?
Successful I hope, for all our sakes.
(Loot clatters and clanks)
Ragnar: The saxons attacked us when we returned to the boat, in great force, (shouts) But we defeated them!
(Crowd erupts in cheers)
You are the man that people say you are... A great adventurer... And I am happy to salute your achievements and to share in the profit of your raid.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
But I don't see my friend, Knut, where... where is he?
Knut is dead.
Dead?
Did he die in the battle?
No.
Then how did he die?
I killed him.
You killed him.
For what reason?
Because he tried to rape my wife, Lagertha.
I find it too convenient that you would make an excuse to kill my friend and my agent on your voyage.
What did you think that you would gain by getting rid of him?
I didn't expect to gain anything.
Earl Haraldson: I don't believe you.
Arrest him!
Ragnar: My lord!
For your wife Siggy would have you not done the same?
(Floki growls)
Svein: I would counsel you all against such actions.
There is no way you could prevail.
Ragnar: Floki.
Svein: Bring him away.
Lagertha: Ragnar! Ragnar!
(Footsteps approach)
You summoned me, lord?
Yes, I want to talk to you.
Please, sit. Drink.
It's, um...
It's a delicate matter.
You...
You are the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok, are you not?
I am.
A spirited man, your brother.
Is he a fair man?
Does he treat you equally when you sail with him?
Up to a point.
Forgive me, but I think that he likes to rule you.
And that whatever he says, in actual fact, he considers himself to be first among equals.
Am I correct?
(Silence)
I get the impression that he wants to...
To take the credit for everything...
For building the boat, for sailing west.
He wants to be the hero.
Is that what it comes down to?
To him?
Would he have achieved what he has achieved if it wasn't for you?
(Silence)
What do you say, Rollo?
Of course not.
It would have been impossible.
As long as I am Earl, Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing.
I, on the other hand, can give you a great deal.
I could, for example, confiscate the treasure that you brought back from england...
And offer you a goodly portion of it.
Would you do that, lord?
I might.
Depends.
On what would it depend?
Your ambition.
You want to stand out.
You want to be someone, Rollo.
You want the gods to notice you, yes?
They would have noticed me already.
Earl Haraldson: Oh no, my friend. And do you know why?
Because you still walk in the shadow of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Don't you think it's time you stepped out from it and let the gods see you for who you really are?
Oh! I want you to say hello to somebody.
This is my daughter, Thyri.
She is soon to get married and I must think very carefully about her future husband.
He must be a man of ambition and prospect, as you can understand.
I used to have two boys but they were killed.
So the man that I choose to be my son-in-law will hold a high and special place, as if he were my own son.
Thyri, say hello to Rollo.
Hello.
Hello.
Siggy: Don't forget about me, my love.
Earl Haraldson: Oh, yes.
And this is Siggy, my wife.
This is Rollo.
He is the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Hello, Rollo.
I have heard a lot about you.
They say that you are a great warrior.
With chatter)
(Door opens)
(Everyone quiets down)
Svein: Bring in the prisoner.
(Crowd jeers loudly)
Woman: That murderer!
(Jeering)
Bjorn: Look at him!
He's in chains.
It's all right, boy.
We are all aware of the sacred nature of our duty here.
You stand before us accused of the willful murder of Knut, my brother.
Knut, as some of you may know, was the b*st*rd son of my father.
But I loved him...
Like a brother.
I asked Knut to...
To go with Ragnar Lothbrok to england, where they raided a town and brought back many spoils.
And while they were raiding this town, Ragnar Lothbrok took it upon himself to cold-bloodedly kill my brother.
It's easy to imagine why a man like this would do such a thing.
This is an ambitious man.
He doesn't care to share his spoils, and he resents the fact that he owes me loyalty and obedience, as his chieftain.
This is a man who does not believe in our traditions.
This is a man who does not believe in our laws.
Crowd: (Sounds of disapproval and disgust)
Svein: Silence! Silence!
Earl Haraldson: What do you have to say, when you stand before us, and know that you must tell the truth?
It is that true that I killed Knut, sadly, your brother.
But I killed him when I found him trying to rape my wife.
I ask all of you freemen, what would have you done if you were in my place?
Would have you just stood back, encouraged the culprit?
I don't think you would.
And even if I had of known at the time he was your brother, I would have carried out the same sentence.
Svein: Do you seriously ask us to believe your story?
I can confirm the story.
(Crowd murmurs)
You are the wife of Ragnar Lothbrok?
I am, lord.
How extraordinary that you happened to be there at the same time.
(Crowd titters)
Your husband is lying and you are so under his thumb that he has persuaded you to lie for him.
May Thor strike you dead!
(Shouts of outrage and disapproval)
Earl Haraldson: What did you say?
My husband did not kill Knut Tjodolf.
Svein: Then who did?
Lagertha: I did! I killed him.
I stabbed him in the heart when he tried his best to rape me.
Svein: A murder is committed and the only witnesses are a husband and his wife.
(Crowd chuckles)
Unfortunately, we can't tell who committed the crime because they both claim credit for it.
You didn't kill my brother.
Look at you, how could you?
He killed my brother.
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.
We have proof.
We have a witness to the killing.
(Whispers of surprise run through the crowd)
Svein: You say you are a witness to the death of Knut Tjodolf?
Yes.
Svein: You'll swear this upon your arm ring?
Yes, I was there.
I saw everything.
Earl Haraldson: So, who killed my brother?
(Fire snaps and crackles)
Ragnar Lothbrok killed him.
(Crowd murmurs)
In cold blood?
No, lord. For a good reason.
What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.
Your half-brother was caught raping a Saxon woman.
Then he attempted to rape Ragnar's lawful wife, Lagertha, the shield-maiden.
So unfortunately...
You cannot punish him.
(Chains jingle) Now who has the key?
(Crowd buzzes with chatter)
(Lively music plays)
(Warriors chatter and laugh)
Woman: Come, Bjorn. Man: Like father like son.
(Laughing)
It seems I owe you an eternal debt.
I know.
And I look forward to collecting it.
Leif: Let's drink a toast to Ragnar!
To his future and his freedom!
No, no, no, no.
To friends and freedom!
All: To friends and freedom!
Arne: (Drunkenly) Not that he'll ever be free of us!
(Laughing)
Ragnar: Will you drink with me?
Of course.
Thank you for taking care of my children.
You're a good Christian.
(Laughs)
(Cup and blow clatter and clank)
I wanted to say thank you.
You did a fine good thing, Rollo.
I hope the gods were watching.
I didn't do it for him.
I did it for you, shield-maiden.
I don't want to believe that.
Floki: Ragnar!
Did you see Haraldson's face when he had to acquit you and then give you half his hoard?
He looked like this!

Seer: Yes.
There is a quarrel.
There will be violence...
Bones and skulls broken. I see that.
(Seabirds cry)
Athelstan: What is Ragnar doing sitting on the hillside?
Seer: He searches for your death; consults the gods to whom he claims kinship.
Who could believe such a thing?
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, will it not be so?
Do the gods speak?
Seer: Do they ever stop?
Gods have always been favorable to me.
They allowed yours sons to die...
Earl Haraldson: Do the gods really exist?
(The seer laughs)
I know what he's doing.
He's preparing himself.

May I ask you something?
Am I still your slave?
Does it matter?
Athelstan: It matters because I have noticed that in your world, slaves are often treated worse than dogs.
Do I treat you like a dog?
Athelstan: That's not my point.
Legally you could beat me to death, and there would be no penalty.
Everyone else in your world is subject to the law.
That's just the way it is.
A man can rape his female slave but not a free woman.
Ragnar: It is true that we distinguish between those captured in battle, and our own free men and women.
In any case, why do you say \"your world\"?
You live here now.
This is your world.
And I've never seen you try to escape.
I am less and less interested in escaping now, even if I could.
But I would like to be a free man.
Ragnar: If it matters so much to you.
It does.
What are you preparing for?

(Foliage crunches underfoot)
(Grunts in pain)
(Grunting in pain)
Lagertha: There he is.
(Exhales)
(Gasps)
(Big splash)
Where is he?
Can you see him?
Bjorn: Where is Father?
He's there somewhere.
(Splash)
Bjorn: Where are they?
Gyda: Father!
Bjorn: Is he dead?
He's dead, isn't he?
He's dead!
Is he dead?
Housecarl: I don't know, Lord.
(Exasperated sigh)
Seize his boat.
Yes, Lord.
He's a criminal.
He's not entitled to property.
And if you come across his family, bring them here so that we can talk to them.
Housecarl: Yes, Lord Haraldson.
Earl Haraldson: You let him escape.
I will not forget that.
(Water churns)
(Cloth rips)
Bjorn: Floki!
Floki!
Floki!
(Door creaks open)
Who are you?
I must speak with Floki. Is he here?
Bjorn?
My father is dying.
Floki: Helga, get the bark of the ash, and the garlic and the sage.
Get the sage.
We make a paste to put on the wounds.
But first we must clean them.
And the only way to make them clean is with fire.
Bjorn, get more logs back there.
A knife...
(Buzz of chatter fills the hall)
(Approaching footsteps)
Earl Haraldson: We must bid welcome to our guest.
Siggy: Guest? You didn't tell me to expect a guest!
This is Earl Bjarni.
He is a Swede.
This is my wife Siggy and my daughter Thyri.
Siggy: You are welcome, My Lord.
Earl Bjarni: Thank you. It was a very hard crossing, I must say.
You are right.
She's very pretty, My Lord Haraldson.
Earl Haraldson: Come, feast with us.
Sit over here.
So that you may get to know each other a little better.
Siggy: Forgive me, but why would they get to know each other better?
Because they're being married.
But he's...
It's arranged.
May I?
You will have no regrets, my dear child.
I will make you a good husband and you will provide me with many sons, of that I am quite certain.
The celebration, shall be later this year, when I shall return, laden with gifts.
In the meantime... please accept this as a token of my affection.
Here, let me.
Earl Haraldson: What do you say, Thyri?
Thyri: Thank you, My Lord.
You are very... kind.
(Fire crackles)
Lagertha: Give that to me.
I dedicate this blade to the goddess, to Freya.
Wisdom might you give us, Freya, and healing hands while we live.
Bjorn: Hail to the aesir.
Gyda: Please Freya, heal my father.
(Flesh sizzles)
Athelstan: For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under the sun.
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and to pluck up what is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal...
Mary mother of God, listen to me:
Do not let this man die.
Siggy: How could you?
Earl Haraldson: It's an excellent match.
He's a powerful man, and he's the cousin of King Horik.
Siggy: He's old and he's ugly.
Earl Haraldson: You don't judge a man by the way he looks.
(Angry sigh)
We've struck a good deal.
He'll give us twenty pounds of silver for her.
Don't you care for her happiness?
I care for her security, and her future... and ours.
This marriage will bring us land and important alliances.
The gods must have seen that we need them.
Siggy: You told me nothing of this marriage.
You have treated me with utter contempt.
You don't care.
I stopped caring about a lot of things... 
when our boys were murdered.
Siggy: They died... you buried them.
And for you, it was the end of the matter.
But for me... they were my sons.
I bore them.
I brought them into this world.
I watched them as they grew.
And I loved them, just as I loved you.
The killers, they dug a shallow grave.
And before they buried them... they cut their heads off.
And when they laid them in the ground, they... they put their faces against their asses... as a sign of disrespect.
If I ever find the man who did that... I will...
I took these locks of hair from their heads.
(Happy exhale)
See Siggy... when you have such knowledge... being married to a rich, old man isn't so bad.

Lagertha: He's still weak... 
but his wounds are beginning to heal, thanks to Foki's magic.
Floki: Torstein.
Ragnar, see who's here.
Torstein: Ragnar, my friend...
How are you?
Ragnar: Save me from these people.
(Laugh turns into a pained grunt)
How did you know I was here?
Torstein: I didn't.
I only know Earl Haraldson is looking for you.
It was Rollo who said that if you're alive, you might be here.
Then why did he not come himself?
Torstein: Because he thought the Earl's men would be looking for him especially.
It is no secret that all of the crew are being watched.
But I made sure no-one followed me.
Floki: Let's eat.
Ragnar: It is good to see you.
Torstein: You too, my friend.
This is Helga.
Hello, Helga.
Floki: Oh, don't wiggle your maggot in her face.
She's taken.
Sit down.
I heard they burned down your farm.
They also slaughtered all our livestock.
We have nothing left.
Floki: You are alive.
Ragnar is alive.
Your children are alive.
You have everything left.
Lagertha: We also need to eat.
And we are already eating some of your winter supplies, Floki.
And I am ashamed.
The gods will provide.
Athelstan: For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die... 
Floki: (Giggles)
Just eat your soup, priest.
Ragnar: Sometimes your God sounds a lot like one of ours.
(Rain patters)
(Owl hoots)
(Flames crackle)
Ragnar: Why did the gods keep me alive?
That is the question I keep asking myself.
Torstein: What are you going to do?
Ragnar: I can do nothing until I am well.
Where's the boat?
Torstein: Haraldson has confiscated the boat.
His daughter is getting married to a man from Svealand.
The boat is her dowry.
Ragnar: Floki can always build us another one.
And the Earl?
(Grunts)
Floki: Pssst!
(Quietly) Come on.
Torstein: What for?
Floki: If you don't come now, I promise, you will regret it.

<U+266A>
(Earl Bjarni laughs)
<U+266A>
I don't remember inviting you to my daughter's wedding.
Well, My Lord, I assumed you'd just forgotten.
So I came anyway.
Here's to happiness for your daughter and may she be blessed with many sons.
Earl Haraldson: That could be you dancing with my daughter.
I often think about it.
Still I was not fated to marry her.
I think that old man was.
Why are you here?
We should talk.
(Clapping their hands to the music)
Svein: Silence! Silence!
Earl Haraldson: It is time for the husband and wife to go to the matrimonial chamber.
(Laughing and cheering)
(Laughs)
Whoa!
(Clapping)
So, what do you want to talk about?
I don't want your thugs, like these fellows, following me around everywhere.
It's a waste of everyone's time.
Oh, I disagree.
If you lead them to Ragnar Lothbrok it will be time well spent.
Ragnar is dead.
Do you swear that on your arm-ring?
Rollo: No.
Then why...
I cannot swear because I have not seen a body.
But I have heard nothing, and he is my brother.
I am sure in my heart he is dead.
What about his wife and children?
They too have disappeared.
Rollo: So I heard.
That you had them killed, frankly, by those fellows there.
So why should I trust you, because you've already betrayed me.
I didn't betray you.
I told the truth.
Shouldn't you trust someone who tells the truth?
So tell me the truth now!
The truth is, you run everything here.
You own the ships.
You decide where it is we raid.
I need to be a part of that.
I don't want to be on the outside.
I want to raid and fight.
It's what I was born to do.
I understand.
And you must understand it will take time for me to trust you.
And I do not give my trust easily.
But you can stay here, eat at my expense, work on my boats, prepare for the season.
Then we shall see.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Good.
(Loud snoring)
Athelstan: So if Odin lives in Valhalla, is he the only God who lives in a great hall?
(Everyone snickers)
Ragnar: No, there are many halls.
Thor lives in Thrudheim.
Lagertha: And Frey was given the hall at Alfheim when he cut his first tooth!
Floki: And nearby is Valhalla, vast and gold-bright.
And every day, Odin chooses slain men to join him.
They arm themselves and fight in the great courtyard.
They kill one another; but every night they rise again and ride back to the hall and feast.
The roof is made out of shields.
The rafters are spears.
Coats of mail litter the benches.
A wolf stands at the western door and an eagle hovers above it.
It has 540 doors, and when Ragnarok comes, 800 warriors will march out of each door, shoulder to shoulder.
Athelstan: What is Ragnarok?
(Silence)
Well then, how was the Earth created?
Helga: The earth was made from the Ymir's flesh and oceans from his blood, when the Titan was thawed from the ice.
The gods, they made hills out of his bones, and trees from his hairs, and the sky dome is his skull.
And out of his brain they shaped the welling dark clouds.
Floki: So, how do you think it was made, priest?
(Fire crackles)
(Sighs)
(Bird chirps)
(Chicken clucks)
(Weak laugh)
Rollo: Siggy.
(Passionate kissing and moaning)
Siggy: No. No.
Rollo: I was sure!
I've come to warn you: you must leave at once, today.
My husband, he hates you.
He has shown me nothing but respect since I came here.
Rollo, believe me.
Get away.
(Door creaks open and shut)

(Breathing heavily)
Earl Haraldson: Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?
(Tugs on his chains)
Where is he?
He's dead.
Are you sure?
(Chuckles)
You said that you always tell the truth.
You seem to have a little trouble opening your mouth.
Perhaps I could make that a little easier for you.
(Unsheathes dagger)
(Frightened gasps)
(Rollo gurgles as the knife slices his flesh)
(Flames crackle)
Gyda: When will he be better?
Ragnar: It's taken too long already.
Lagertha: In a few weeks' time your father's wounds will be healed if he is careful.
Bjorn: You must have patience, Father.
(Mockingly) You must have patience, Father.
Shut-up.
(The door bursts open)
Bjorn: Torstein!
Floki: I found him wandering around the marshes.
Torstein: I was lost.
I was visited in great secrecy by Earl Haraldson's wife, Siggy.
She told me that her husband had played a trick on Rollo... and imprisoned him, trying to find where you were.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
Torstein: Yes.
Siggy is sure her husband means to kill him because Rollo will not, in any way, admit to where you are.
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
(Fire crackles)
(Grunts)
(Rain patters outside)
(Grunts)
Ragnar: Floki.
I have another favor to ask of you.
I want you to go into Kattegat.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl.
And when you meet him, challenge him to a personal combat with me.
Tell him, if he refuses shame will stalk him for the rest of his life, and Odin will never permit him into Valhalla.
<U+266A>
Next time on Vikings.
They came in three ships, and those ships are now sailing up the tide.
They have ships that can cross the oceans but also sail up rivers.
I'm with child.
You have made me a happy man.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
Me.

Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.

He's dead!
I've come to warn you. My husband, he hates you.

He tortured my brother?

<U+266A> If I had a voice I would sing <U+266A>
(low hum of chatter in the hall)
Svein: What is it?
(Floki giggles)
Housecarl 1: My lord, this man says he has a message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
(Everyone laughs)
(Laughter stops)
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge, then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame in accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously; That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat, he will be put in chains.
The seer: Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
(Water rushes)
(Lagertha and Ragnar moan in pleasure)
(Fire crackles)
Ragnar...
What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
Ragnar: He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Ragnar: Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
(Breathing heavily)
Lagertha: You don't believe that and neither do I.
Ragnar: You are wrong: I do believe it.
(Howling in the distance)
Siggy: (Quietly) Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Earl Haraldson: Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't... Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Siggy: Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be... restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the Western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Siggy: Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok, was the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true, our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the Western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
(Earl Bjarni shouts out in pleasure)
Earl Bjarni: I'm sure that's our first child.
(Panting)
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have s*x, in any case!
Thyri: Very well.
I'll go.
Earl Bjarni: I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri: I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
(Groans)

Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence...

Old man: Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
(Crowd laughs)
Tostig: By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
(Crowd laughs)
(Silence)
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
tostig: That I am too old?
(Chuckles)
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead and feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods!
While I... I am forsaken.
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle, and join my friends in Valhalla.
Ragnar: (Grunts in pain)
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
All: Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.

Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.

<U+266A> it is horrible
<U+266A> now to look around
(she continues to sing)
Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died, all of his slave women were asked: \"Who wants to die with him?\"
This one agreed.

She wants to die?

What are they doing?
She is having s*x with the men that live in there.

Because she will soon be reunited with her master in death, and she will be able to speak to him.

How can you be sure?
Rollo: My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
(Relieved sigh) Well...
Even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.

The skies will open and Surt the fire-giant will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent, but die from its venom.
(Wolf snarls)
Surt will spread fire across the earth.

King Aelle: So where did these Northmen come ashore?
Messenger: They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
Messenger: They came in three ships, and those ships are now sailing up the Tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans but also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the Tyne, then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Ah yes, my lord Wigea, of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers, which is why a small force of them defeated you.
Lord Wigea: I merely said they fought like demons, like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, my lord?
I fear death as much as the next man, but I have no fear that afterwards God will raise me up again.
Oh, well said. (Claps)
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
(Chains clank, flaps creak)
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak and afraid to fight to the death for their king and master.
My lord! No! No!
You look terrified, my lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore that God will raise you up from the grave?
Lord Wigea: Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
(Hissing)
No! Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
(Yells out in pain as a snake bites him)
Now let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.

Siggy: We have to leave here. They will shun us like a bad smell.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
Tostig: I have been a warrior all my life.
I beg you, lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle.

Noble: (Shouts) Brother!
Brother! Where are you?
King Aelle: Aethelwulf?!
(Laughs)
Thank God you are come.
Lord Aethelwulf: What on earth made you think I would not, sire?
King Aelle: No, I never doubted you. But others...
Our own youngest brother, fled to Mercia.
He was always the runt of the litter.
Our parents should've drowned him at birth.
(Laughs)
Where are the heathens now?
Only one, perhaps two days away and your forces are ready and armed?
Yes, if you are ready to lead them.
I would regard it a great honor, sire, to defend thy kingdom and our homeland.
Lord Edgar: And there's no man better, lord Aethelwulf.
The poets sing your battle praises in the halls.
That's because I paid them.
(Everyone laughs)
If you paid them, they'd sing your praises too.
That's poets for you!

My lady, pray, have you no time for laughter?
No, my lord Aethelwulf, only for fear.

Lagertha: Good day to you, folk. What is the problem here?
Peasant man: The problem is her!
What has she done?
Peasant man: She has had a child - the boy in her arms.
What of it?
He's not my child.
(Crowd murmurs)
We tried for many years to have children, but without success.
And then, just over a year ago, a young man came to the door.
I remember the day, I was making a loom.
The young man said his name was Rig.
He gave us some good advice on our work and stayed at our house.
After three days, he left...
And then nine months later, she gave birth to a son.
(Crowd laughs, baby cries)
Whose child is it?
(Tearful)
I do not know, my lady.
We were all in the same bed.
I was too scared-you see?
She is not an honest woman.
She had s*x with Rig, and could not bring herself to tell me the truth!
Do you know who this Rig was?
No. He was just a young man.
On the contrary.
We know from our ancient stories that Rig is another name for Heimdal.
The God Heimdal?
Peasant man: My lady!
Yes, the God Heimdal!
You are fortunate that he chose your household to appear in.
That's just a story!
Our whole lives are just stories.
You should be ashamed you did not trust your wife, despite the joy and comfort she has brought you, and the fact that a God chose you of all people to visit.
Do not punish her, but rejoice with her.
Drink wine with her.
And sacrifice one of your animals to Heimdal the God.
But if I hear you have harmed this woman, or this child, you will answer for it to me!
(Crowd murmurs quietly)
(Steady clopping of hooves)
(Water splashing)
(Thundering of hooves)
Lord Aethelwulf: It seems they intend to stay here a while.
I had not expected that.
My lord, why don't we attack?
They have a strong position.
Perhaps if we can make them leave their position and attack us.
Saxon warrior 1: How can we force them to do that?
They're scavengers, little more than beasts.
We must be able to out-think them.
Saxon warrior 2: If we leave it much longer, they'll be even better dug-in.
My lord, if a wolf comes into your sheep fold, you don't try to out-think it.
You go in and drive it away, or kill it!
How dare you argue with me?!
Saxon warrior 2: Lord Aethelwulf, forgive us. We only meant... lord Aethelwulf: I know what you meant.
You meant that you're already greater warriors than I am... although only yesterday you were still green sucking on your mother's breasts.
Go do your jobs. Set up camp.
(Banging and tapping)
Rollo: You see them up there?
Ragnar: Yes, I can see them.
What're we waiting for?
To see what they'll do.
So you want to hand them the initiative.
We can't afford to lose half our men by being stupid and attacking.
We wait until the odds are in our favor.

Ragnar: Who are you?
I'm lord Aethelwulf, brother of king Aelle.
Ragnar: You are the brother of the king, yet you lead his army?
Hmm.
Does he send you to fight all his battles?
In the bedroom too?
Floki: Ragnar!
Come and see!
Rollo: Their iron is stronger and better than ours.
(Hard whack)
Leif: (Laughs) And we've captured a dozen of their horses.
Floki: I'm hungry already!
Ragnar: What ails you my friend?
The gods won't lift my curse.
I am fated to live forever on this miserable earth.
(Men chatter quietly)
Rollo: Who is this?
Ragnar: This?
This is the king's brother.
What do you say?
Shall we go visit the king?
King Aelle: God help us!
My brother defeated. Dead.
God help Northumbria.
Lord Edgar: Sire, we do not know if your brother is dead.
King Aelle: But we do know, my lord, that he was defeated!
Who are these barbarians, these savages?
Why have they come to torment us?
Bishop Unwan: Sire, some learned and wise men say that these northmen have been sent here by God to punish our people for their many sins and transgressions.
That we have departed from the path of righteousness that our lord set out, so now he is holding us to terrible account.
(Nobles mutter in agreement)
Noble 3: Forgive me, sire, but what if God has not sent these northmen here to plague us?
Then who has, pray?
Could it not, sire, rather be the work of the devil?
(Nobles mutter in agreement)
King Aelle: Go on then, my lord. What is your advice?
Noble 3: My advice, sire, is that, as we are facing the forces of Satan, we must resist them at all costs.
Even at the cost of... Of all our lives, if necessary.
For evil cannot be accommodated nor yet ever bargained with.
Several nobles: Aye! (Murmuring)
Noble 4: Sire, if I might speak?
I-I put it to you that it might be that these pagans have come here by their own account, and that they are neither of God nor the devil.
They are just savage men more interested in robbery and plunder than in matters of the spirit.
King Aelle: Then what is your advice?
(Nobles yelling)
Noble 4: Sire, since they have come for gain, then let us offer them enough money, or whatever else they desire, to go away and leave us in peace!
(Nobles yell and shout)
Noble 2: Shame! Shame on you! Shame on you!
Noble 5: He is right!
Why waste more blood?
Let's pay them off!
(Nobles yell and shout, divided)
King Aelle: My lords, let me think on it, just a little while.
In the meantime, let it be known I have sent envoys out to raise more men to arms, for our use if need be.
Nobles: (Muttering quietly)
Long live the king!
(Hall buzzes with chatter)
King Aelle: (Sotto voce) Contend, o lord, against those who contend with me;
Fight against those who fight against me!
Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers; Say to my soul, \"I am your salvation.\"

Lord Eadric: Greetings.
King Aelle invites your leader to meet him in his villa to talk.
Who is your leader?
(Silence)
The king did not know that his brother was still alive.
He would like to talk to you about what he can give you, to set his brother free.
Do you accept the king's invitation?
Where are you going?
(Hooves thud loudly)
(Birds sing, foliage crunches underfoot)
Rollo: We should attack, while they are weak.
How long will it take them to raise another army?
Ragnar: Attack, attack, attack!
That's all he ever says.
I want to talk to the king.
Rollo: What is there to talk about?
Imagine the treasures the king keeps in his household?
I want them.
I want to see how he lives...
What manner of men they are, and I'm hungry.
Rollo: Listen to me: If we agree to walk into his house he can kill each and every one of us.
Ragnar: You forget, we hold his brother hostage.
Why should he care about his brother?
Do I not care about mine?

King Aelle: Ah yes, Ragnar Lothbrok...
We've heard that name before.
We are pleased you have decided to talk to us.
(Quiet, nervous whispers)
Perhaps, sire, you should invite them to eat first.
Forgive me. Let us feast together...
And then talk.
(Floki giggles)
Noble: The king!
King Aelle: Ragnar Lothbrok, may I present my wife Ealswith, and my son, Egbert.

King Aelle: Very well.
What do you want, for the safe return of my brother and for leaving my kingdom?
Is he a priest?
He's a bishop of our church.
A man of God.
I too have a man of God at home.
Two thousand pounds in gold and silver.
Bishop Unwan: What did he say?
How much?
Two thousand pounds.
I do not think I heard you properly, Ragnar Lothbrok.
Ragnar: (Lightly) Hmm...
(Bellows loudly)
Two thousand pounds in weight.
(Nobles laugh derisively)
That is the price.
(Viking belches)
(Hall goes quiet)
(Benches scrape back)
(Metallic rasp of weapons being drawn)
I agree to the terms.
Ragnar: (Belches) Good.
(Laughing)
King Aelle: But first...
You must return my brother.
Ragnar: When we receive payment, you shall have your brother.
You must give me time to collect such a vast amount.
And in the meantime, you and your men must remain in your camp and make no further attacks on my people or their property.
Agreed.
Lord Eadric: Sire! How can we trust the word of a pagan?
Bishop Unwan: Let me baptize one of them.
There is one further condition.
I desire that either you, or one of your companions, agrees to be baptized into our faith.
And that way, I can make peace with a friend and fellow Christian...
And not an enemy.
Ragnar: You want one of us to become Christian?
Yes.
(Speaking old norse)
(Vikings laugh)
Leif: Tostig!
(Laughing)
Rollo: (Speaking old norse)
I... will be Christian.
(Geese honk)
Athelstan: My lady Lagertha, I hope you can find it in your heart to speak to the wife of the late Earl.
Of course. Hello, Siggy.
Please sit down and join us.
Bjorn wait!
Earl Haraldson tried to kill my father.
(Sighs heavily) I know.
And if he had succeeded, I would be standing where Siggy's standing now.
So what would you like me to say to her?
I would ask her to sit down.
Siggy: Thank you.
What can I do for you?
Siggy: It is what I can do for you.
I want to serve you.
That is not necessary.
I remember very well how I served the father of my church, and it did me no harm.
In fact, I found in service a great freedom and honor.
When I accepted that I should forget about myself and serve father Cuthbert...
Well... then I became happy.
If it's really what you want, I accept your offer.
Thank you.
Lagertha: You and your daughter are now under my protection, but I will never treat you as a servant.
(River babbles loudly)
Bishop Unwan: O lord, holy father, almighty and eternal God, expel the devil and his kin from this person: From the head, from the hair, from the brain, from the brow, from the ears, from the nostrils, from the mouth, from beneath the tongue, from the throat, from the neck, from the chest, from the heart, from the entire interior of the body, from the thoughts, from the words, and from the deeds, in the name of Jesus Christ our lord.
King Aelle and saxons: Amen.
Bishop Unwan: I anoint thee...
In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit.
Amen.
Rollo: (Sputters)
Priests: Et spiritus sancti.
(Vikings laugh hysterically)
Bishop Unwan: I now pronounce you baptized and born again, with the new Christian name of Rolf.
(Vikings laugh)
May the lord bless you and keep you, from this day hence, and for ever.
Amen.
(Laughter dies down)
(Spits angrily)
King Aelle: We have witnessed a true miracle.
Now I ask you to fulfill your promises, return to your ships, and await your payment in peace.
Agreed, Ragnar Lothbrok?
(Horses whinny)
(Water splashes, rollo laughs)
(Howling in the distance)
(Fire crackles nearby)
(Crackling)
What is it?
I can't sleep.
Come here, beside me, daughter.
What worries you?
I fear for father, so far away.
Our lives are fated, Gyda.
We all have to accept that.
Gyda: I can feel it moving underneath my hand.
Mm-hmm. He has a strong kick.
He? Are you so sure it's a boy?
A long time ago, the seer prophesized that your father would have many sons.
That's how I know it's a boy.
Now sleep.
(Men chatter and laugh)
Warriors: Oh!
(Dice rattles)
(All laugh)
Rollo: (Laughing) I won again!
(Under his breath)
Well done... Rolf!
What's wrong with you, Floki?
Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.
I did not renounce the gods in front of everyone.
It was a joke.
I didn't believe it.
I didn't even know what the old fool was saying.
Floki: It doesn't matter.
Surely you've made them very angry.
Rollo: Don't be stupid.
Floki: No, you are the stupid one...
To risk the wrath of the gods.
How will you ever get Odin to forgive you now?

Ragnar: Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala, to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us.
For protecting us, for the success in battle, for the rains that they bring that grow our crops and, of course, for our children.
This year I was not going to go, for there is too much to do around here.
Then my unborn son was cruelly taken from me, and it made me wonder what I had done to anger the gods.
What do christians do about such pain?
In the Bible, it says that all sorrows will pass.
In any case, I've decided to go.
I'm going to take the children for the first time, for it's important that they go.
What about you?

Hail to Odin's spear, Thor's hammer.
Hail to the mighty fecund earth.
All...
All hail.
Lothbrok family: All hail.
All hail.
Bjorn: You know who that is, don't you?
Athelstan: Of course.
This is Thor, holding his hammer, Mjollnir.
Who hasn't heard him beating his anvil in the storm?
Who doesn't believe in mighty Thor, slayer of frost and fire?
Priest: Freja, Loki, and Frigg.
Hail to Lin, Ifon, and Mimir.
Hail to Njord, Ran, and Tyr.
Hail to Odin...
Lagertha: (Whispering)
Frey, lord, fill me with seed and give me a son.
Do as you will with me, make me blind or deaf if you want to, but give me a son before it's too late.
Priest: Hail to... Crowd: All hail.
Priest: Hail to Freja, loki, and Frigg.
Bjorn: Odin, father.
I have come to ask for your love.
I want to grow and to prosper, to quicken and be wise. Hear me, lord.
Crowd: All hail.
Priest: Hail to the Aesir and the Vanir.
Hail to the gods and goddesses...
Ragnar: Lord of lords, father, hear my prayer.
Let me understand your will.
Is it true that I shall have more sons like the seer says?
Accept the sacrifice I plan to offer you...
And then answer me.
Priest: Hail to the Aesir and the Vanir.
Hail to the gods and goddesses...
Hail to Odin, Thor...
Who will bear me my son?
Priest: Sif, and Heimdall.
Hail to Balder, Bragi, and Eir.
Hail to Freja, loki, and Frigg.
(Sharp thump)
How good is this, rollo?
Especially because we're here together.
Yes, while we're here in Uppsala let us enjoy and revel in every moment.
(Water sloshes in bucket)
Have you been here before, Helga?
Helga: No.
Do you know what happens here?
I've heard some stories.
Rollo: And they're all true.
But they still don't prepare you for what really happens here.
(Men chuckle)
I can't wait to find out.
When is the food ready, Helga?
I'm hungry.
You're always hungry.
Of course I am... But not always for food.
Men: (Howling, barking and laughing)
Ragnar: Can you feel it, Gyda?
Can you sense the presence of the gods gathering here?
They have left their bright halls to see us.
Torstein: They are here for sure.
They walk among us.
Leif: And make their judgments on us.
So when do we offer our sacrifices?
Arne: At the end of the festival.
Torstein: And in the meantime, we celebrate the gods and enjoy their presence in any way we can.
Arne and Torstein: (Chuckles)
Ragnar: Give Athelstan a drink.
Arne: Priest... your cup.
(Exhales)
(Cups clunk)
Gyda: Mother, you came here before?
Once.
And did you ask the gods for anything?
Yes. And they granted my every desire.

What is this?
These will all be killed as sacrifices.
Six, seven, eight, nine.
Seven, eight, nine.
And nine goats, and nine pigs.
There's nine of everything!
Yes, nine of every kind.
Athelstan: And this?
It's for all the humans that have been chosen.
Rollo: Come join us, priest.
Helga: Drink.

There are great stories and legends told about him.
Thank you.

It is hard for me to let go of you.

Fools! This is king Horik.
(Exhales)
(Goats bleat, pigs grunt)
<U+266A>
Ragnar: Athelstan, I want you to meet someone.
(Goats bleat)
King Horik: Ha! Ha! You must be Ragnar Lothbrok!
I must tell you it is my privilege and pleasure to clap eyes on you.
Your reputation goes ahead of you, Ragnar Lothbrok.
I know this because so many have told me how you killed Earl Haraldson and then built a new kind of ship... were the first to sail west and defeated a king of england!
In fact, I can hardly believe my eyes that you are standing right here in front of me.
Please, please.
Ragnar: Travelers and storytellers have described how you came to your throne by defeating, one by one, the six uncles that killed your father.
And my mother, and all my sisters and brothers.
Ragnar: I also know how you favor the poets at your court, and your people respect your law making, your justice, and your rule.
And as a consequence, here, on this site, in the living presence of the gods, I offer you my fealty and my service.
I accept your pledge, with a glad heart.
What can I do for you in return?
You could join forces with me.
I am not satisfied with what I have achieved so far.
I want to send bigger raiding parties to the west; Yes, to plunder, but also to explore new lands.
There are other lands to the west?
There is a kingdom called Frankia... a kingdom far larger, far richer, and far more powerful than england.
Athelstan, come.
Come.
This man has seen it.
Athelstan: I was a Christian monk in england.
I traveled to other lands as a missionary.
I have heard of christians, and of their God.
And are you still a Christian?
No.
King Horik: Of course not!
How could you be a Christian and walk among our gods?
I share your appetite for new adventure, Ragnar Lothbrok, and I will gladly join forces with you, since, as king, I am naturally not in favor of individual enterprise by my earls, or anyone else.
But, believe me, I will be happy enough just to have my name linked with yours when the poets tell the story of how we norsemen sailed west and discovered new worlds.
(Clapping backs)
Please, come. Eat, eat.
(Stumbling)
Siggy: Why did you bother to come back?
Rollo: I was hungry.
Hmm.
How many women have you been with?
I don't suppose you know.
I do what I want here.
I thought we came here together.
We came here with Earl Ragnar.
I thought we came here together and... we did come here together.
We are together.
Why do you keep pestering me?
(Scoffs)
I am who I am and I won't change, not for you, not for my brother, not for anyone.
So leave if you want to.
But one day I will be a great man and you'll regret leaving me just because I sleep with other women.
If you really want to be a great man, should you not be meeting with king Horik now?
What do you mean?
Siggy: Well, that's where your brother is now, and no doubt he's already boasting about how he sailed west, alone, and all he has achieved... Alone.
If you weren't so stubborn and so drunk, you would be there too, but you weren't invited.
You didn't even know about it.
I could have told you.
You see, rollo, you need me as much as I need you.
(Plate scrapes)
That is, if you really want to be something.
(Light thump)
King Horik: Ragnar Lothbrok, I drink to your good fortune.
May the gods continue to favor you and increase your fame.
May they do the same to you, king Horik.
You have done me the honor of pledging your fealty, as Earl, to me.
Forgive me, then, if I seem anxious to make use of your skills and reputation...
As soon as possible.
To do what?
There is a Jarl in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.
He is an important fellow, but he continues to claim he has legal rights over some of my land.
He threatens me.
He nearly invaded my territory a year ago, but at the last moment he drew back.
And now, once again, he is making threatening noises.
And how can I be of help in such a matter?
Would you be prepared to travel to Gotaland as my emissary?
I can think of no one who I would rather represent my case, for your fame is widespread.
If the issue is settled, I shall be forever in your debt.
What do you say?
(Light thump)
(Rhythmic drumming, chimes tinkle)

(Ominous howls)
Priest: Have you come here of your own free will?
(Wind gusts strongly)
Yes.
Priest: At first, I was suspicious of you.
I sensed something, so I spoke to lord Ragnar.
He told me your story: That you were a priest, that you were a Christian, and worshipped a God called Jesus Christ.
Is that true?
Yes.
And do you still worship this God?
Are you still, in your heart, a Christian?
No.
Say again.
No.
And a third time... say it.
(Whispered) No.
You know why you're here, don't you?
You have been brought here as a sacrifice to the gods.
<U+266A>
Athelstan: (Gasps)
(Frightened gasp)
(Running footsteps)
Seer: I have come to tell you that the sacrifice of this man will not please the gods.
He is neither willing nor is his faith acceptable to Odin.
His heart is corrupt.
He has not renounced his false God.
Ragnar: Looks like your God finally came through for you.
Seer: Instead, one amongst you must agree to take his place tomorrow at the sacrifice.
If not, then all shall fail.
The gods in their anger will punish everyone, and withdraw their protection from all of us.
(Whispering) No, not you.
(Hard clap on the back)
Leif: Before anyone else can claim this honor, I desire to be sacrificed.
For the sake of my family, for the sake of all of you, my friends.
But even more, for the sake of all humans in Midgard.
I trust that the gods will find my sacrifice acceptable.
In which case, I look forward to it joyfully.

Arne: Especially if they've been traveling for days on end.

Jarl Borg: Are you the emissaries from King Horik?
Well, I can tell you at once you're wasting your time. It's my land--
and I want it returned to me.
That's all I have to say.
Ragnar: He wants to make peace with you and come to some kind of agreement.
Then tell him if he leaves my land, we can have peace.
But not before.
How can you make peace, Jarl Borg, if you insist on humiliating him?
Jarl Borg: If I invade and defeat him, will he not be even more humiliated?
Ragnar: Not if he fights well.
In any case, I am sure that he would relish a fight.
(Taps mug on table)
What's your name?
Ragnar Lothbrok.
You are Ragnar Lothbrok, the one who sailed west?
I am surprised that you've heard about that.
(Laughs)
How are you surprised?
Everyone has heard of your exploits.
Why have we not offered our guests dry clothes and food?
Treat these folk well.
Give them ale, let them dry out, feed them.
Tomorrow, you and I will talk again, Ragnar Lothbrok.

(Fire crackles)
You see?
I have fears.
Siggy: Go to the Seer, ask if your fears will come true.
It's sometimes better not to know one's fate.
Jarl Borg: I take it, from what you said yesterday, that King Horik is prepared to compromise and offer some deal regarding those lands of mine, which he still occupies?
He is prepared to pay you to renounce your illegal claims of his lands.
Jarl Borg: You disappoint me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.
I thought you'd come here with a serious purpose.
If you would just name your price.
Jarl Borg: The land is priceless, which is why King Horik wants to keep it for himself.
Rollo: Every piece of land has a price, just like every human.
Jarl Borg: Well, you don't understand.
This is not a small plot of land on which to grow turnips and onions.
We're talking about a vast swathe of land, and on this land, in the earth, are minerals, things of great value.
Why else would I assert my claim?
Ragnar: King Horik resists your claim, but still, in good faith, he is willing to settle with you.
Rollo: If you will name a reasonable price.
At the moment, my price is King Horik's head.
(Borg's men laugh)
Ragnar: Well then, it seems I am done.
Jarl Borg: Hold on, please, sit down, sit down.
Let's see if we can find another way.
What do you have in mind?
What if my claim was acknowledged but I was willing to lease the land back to the king during his lifetime?
Or what if we deferred judgment on ownership, but shared the mineral rights?
What do you say, can we start negotiating in this manner?
(Cutlery clatters, Rollo claps Ragnar on the back)
Why not?
Ragnar: I have not been given the authority to... negotiate in this manner.
You mean King Horik sent you here with nothing but a demand?
And yet he speaks of peace!
I don't know what is in his mind.
Jarl Borg: Well then, maybe you should ask him.
(Borg's men laugh)
Jarl Borg: Let me make a suggestion: Why don't you send one of your men back so he can put to King Horik my ideas for a remedy.
If you think that will work.
Jarl Borg: Good. Your messenger will take several days.
So, in the meantime, why don't you and your men go and visit our famous ash tree?
It is famous not only for its size but because it never loses its leaves, summer or winter.
Some people even say it's Yggdrasil, the tree that holds up the sky.
And I will provide you an escort.
I only have one, very small request.
I would like one of your men to stay behind here as a kind of security.
You understand, I hope?
(Swishes drink through teeth)
My brother Rollo will stay behind.
(Mug thunks on table)

Guide: It can take us three days to reach the tree.
It looks like rain.
Come.
(Chicken clucks, low hum of chatter)
Seer: Why have you come?
Lagertha: I am frightened for my husband.
Seer: Do you think your husband is in some kind of danger?
I've had strange and disturbing dreams.
What happens in your dreams?
Lagertha: Dark shapes come to me at night.
Monstrous forms.
When I wake, they skulk in the shadows, shapeless, but no sooner am I asleep than they creep forward again.
Seer: Ah, yes.
The shadows come from hell's hall.
No one can ensnare them, not even the gods.
Lagertha: What is it that they want?
To take something from you.
My life?
Seer: No, something far more important to you than that.
My husband's life?
(Sighs)
Tell me.
Seer: Why must you all force me up and unearth me to sorrows?
Your husband is in danger, but not for his life.
He is in danger from the magical world.
How?
(Sighs)
Answer me.
Seer: I was unwilling to speak and I will say no more now!
(Twig snaps)
So, Rollo, how do you get on with your brother?
We get along fine.
Why shouldn't we?
No reason.
But not all brothers get on so well.
I know that from personal experience.
What do you mean?
I too had a brother.
I loved him.
We were very close, as befits blood brothers.
We fought together in the shield-wall.
We shared the same women.
When my father was killed, there was fierce competition to replace him as jarl.
And although I was his eldest son I was not sure I was going to succeed.
However, I was elected at the thing.
We had a feast to celebrate.
My wife was there... my young, beautiful wife -
we'd just gotten married -
and all the others who had stood for election against me.
My brother poisoned them... all.
I only survived because... my wife took the cup I was about to drink from and drained it herself in celebration.
I will never forget her screams.
It's my wife's screams that will haunt me for the rest of my life.
My brother denied responsibility, but his guilt was too obvious.
So I blinded him with my own hands, and then I burned him alive.
That's what I know about the love between brothers.
(Fire crackles)
Ragnar... would never do such a thing.
Of course not.
No, your brother is different.
Your brother's a great man, a great warrior.
As am I.
I'm sure you are.
And yet I've never heard of you.
(Retreating footsteps)
(Rushing water)
Nils: Whoa...

Arne: (Struggling grunts)
Torstein: Arne!
Servant 1: What? You're going to try to kill us for protecting the reputation of our mistress?
Ha! Shame on you!
Arne: We came upon your mistress by chance.
We are strangers here, traveling to the great ash tree, guests of Jarl Borg.
Servant 1: Jarl Borg? Then why didn't you say so at once?
Torstein: We will just return to our horses then.
You spied on me.
We meant no harm.
Servant 1: They say they are guests of Jarl Borg.
Are you alone?
We are traveling with Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.
Then I think that Earl Ragnar owes me an apology on your behalf.
Don't you?
Ragnar: I never knew that fresh fish was also packed in salt.
Listen, it's not our fault.
We just saw her bathing. What were we supposed to do?
Fish.
You did not see her, Ragnar.
So you get your cheek slashed and now I'm supposed to apologize for you two staring at a naked body.
That's what she said.
Who is she, anyway, to put such a high price on her nakedness?
We didn't ask.
I'm intrigued.
What's so intriguing?
Sometimes the gods put things like this in front of us as some kind of test.
She has set me a challenge and I am up to task.
See, I'm less interested in what you say is her beauty, than what I suspect is her wit.
So tell her I invite her here to join us...
Neither dressed nor undressed.
What else?
Neither hungry nor full, neither in company nor alone.
Can you remember all of that, one eye?
(Goats bleat, geese honk)
Siggy: What did the Seer tell you?
He said that it's true; That Ragnar is in danger.
From whom?
I don't know.
Who do you think?
(Seagulls cry outside)
I think he is in danger from himself.
(Water rushes nearby, men chatter quietly)
Man: Have you ever been to Yggdrasil before?
Man 2: No.
(Birds chirp, chatter dies down)
Young woman: So, Earl Ragnar, I come to you as you desired: Neither dressed nor undressed, neither hungry nor full, neither alone... nor yet in company.
Do I pass your test?
I owe you an apology.
I accept.
Could I offer you some, uh, horrible salted fish?
I'm very tempted.
You can get tired of fresh fish.
Come.
Sit, please.
May I ask your name?
My name is Aslaug.
We're on our way to see the great ash tree.
Of course.
You are welcome to join us.
Will you come along, Aslaug?
(Low hum of chatter, fire crackles)
Siggy: (Gasps)
Siggy, what is it?
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Oh, I visited my cousin a few days ago.
She had just buried her young son.
Why did he die?
One day he was fine, and the next he caught a fever that made him sweat and cry out in the night, and the next day... she put him in the ground.

All things are possible.

(Doors burst open)

My father is making a fool of himself.
Arne: He's enjoying himself in the company of a beautiful woman.
What's foolish about that?
Some day you'll do the same thing.
If Lagertha were here, she'd cut his balls off.
Arne: (Laughs)
Then it's a good thing she's not.
Listen to me, my friend.
Your father and mother are a famous couple.
They love each other. Everybody knows that.
So don't begrudge your old man a little harmless fun, huh?
(Claps Bjorn on the back, laughs heartily)

(Ale pours from pitcher)
Jarl Borg: I trust all is to your satisfaction.
You feed me very well.
Jarl Borg: You're an important guest.
We would like to keep you entertained until your brother returns.
You always talk about my brother.
What choice do I have?
He is your earl.
(Sighs, annoyed)
Which one would you like tonight?
Why don't you take both of them?
I don't need to be bribed with women.
What is it you want, Rollo?
What is it you really want?
(Thunder of galloping hooves)
Floki: Fenrir, the giant wolf, could not be constrained by any means known to man, so the dwarves forged a chain, but not from metal.
Nothing made by man could constrain Fenrir, so they forged it from the things we cannot see and the things we cannot hear.
Like the breath of a fish... the sound a moving cat makes.
The roots... of a mountain.
You know?
(Laughs)
Of course I know!
These things interest me!
(Horse whinnies nearby)
I came to ask about Jarl Borg.
He won't sell.
He wants to make a deal.
King Horik: I'm not interested in deals.
That would make it hard for Ragnar.
King Horik: Ragnar will come to the right conclusion, and make the right decision.
Don't you care if the negotiations fail?
(Non-committal)
Mm...
(Gasps)
Look!
(Rain patters)
(Water pours)
(Coughs and gasps)
(People cough and wheeze)
(Water drips as Lagertha wrings out a cloth)
(Weakly)
I am going to die.
No, you are not going to die.
The Seer might think that he is the only one in Kattegat with the gift of prophecy, but he's wrong, and I know you are not going to die.
(Coughing and wheezing)
Aslaug: I should tell you the truth about who I really am.
I am Princess Aslaug.
My mother was the shield-maiden Brunhilde.
Everyone knows the renown of your mother.
But I am not her.
I am myself.
Both my parents are dead now, and I did not know them anyway.
Why did you come along with me?
Because I had no choice.
Hmm...
(Kissing)
Why did you do that?
Because I had no choice.
(Men snore softly)
(Soft sighs of pleasure)
(Kissing, sighing with pleasure)
(Birds chirping)
(Horse nickers)
Bjorn: I hate you.
It's disgusting.
I could not help myself.
Shall I tell that to Lagertha, your wife?
If you want to.
You cannot love her that much after all, no matter what you say, no matter what people think.
I don't care what people think.
Of course I love your mother.
(Men chatter quietly)
Bjorn: Swear to me that it will not happen again.
I swear to you it won't happen again.
I love you.
(Swift kiss)
Now, go play.
(Chuckles)
(Bird chirps)
Man: (Coughing violently)

(Chickens cluck)

(People coughing and wheezing)
Siggy: (Screaming hysterically)
No!
(Wailing)
No!
(Wailing)
No!
(Gut-wrenching sobs)
(Weakly)
Athelstan?
(Quietly) He is so weak he cannot eat.
Pray to the gods, please, for him.
(Comforting kiss)
(Grunts of effort)
(Torchlight crackles)
(Flames crackle and roar)
(Men snoring softly)
(Kissing)
(Gasping and sighing with pleasure)
Ragnar: (Whispers)
Wait, no.
(Gasps)
I said no.
(Panting)
(More forcefully)
No.
(Ragged breathes)
(Men snore softly)
(Takes a calming breath, exhaling sharply)
Lagertha: Lord of lords... we make this offering to you, hoping you will find it pleasing.
(Slits goat's throat, goat bleats)
(Blood splatters)

Woman: Can you try a little more?
(Low hum of chatter, people coughing)
Gyda...
(People coughing)
(Low hum of chatter and laughter)
Torstein: Enjoy!
Arne: What's wrong with you?
(Low hum of chatter)
(River water flows)
I'm carrying your child.
Did the Seer not promise you more sons?
(Water flows, birds chirp)
(Chatter and laughter)

(Bird keens in the distance)
(Hooves clop loudly)
Whoa...
(Horse whinnies)
(Hall buzzes with chatter and laughter)
Jarl Borg: We welcome our guests to this feast.
Now tell us what you learned from King Horik?
What compromises is he willing to make?
Floki: Can I not eat first?
(Guests murmur quietly)
Well, he said...
What did he say?
Floki: (Chewing noisily)
(Forcefully)
What did he say?
He will make no compromises, no deals.
He say you must name your price for the land.
Or?
He didn't say \"or.\"
It seems your mission has been entirely wasted, Ragnar Lothbrok.
You and your men must leave here in the morning.
Unless you want to repudiate King Horik, renounce your allegiance to him.
(Flames crackle)
Jarl Borg: I see.
Very well.
(Chair scrapes backward)
(Retreating footsteps)
Good.
(Chewing loudly)
War.
(Slurps some ale)
(Flames crackling)

Odin...
(Inhales sharply)
(Exhales slowly)
(Flesh glides open, Ragnar winces)
(Exhales)
(Ragged breath)
(Fire crackles)
So, my friend, the die is cast.
King Horik has left me no choice.
I must attack him and claim what is rightfully mine.
Your brother will clearly not support me, but the question is, will you?
(Fire crackles)
<U+266A>
(Sharp clunk)
(Footsteps thud lightly)
(Short, sharp caws)
(Cawing)
(Foreboding music)
<U+266A>
<U+266A>
Will you fight alongside me?
Together, you and I can carve out the new kingdom.
<U+266A>
Jarl Borg: Isn't that what you really want?
The death of your brother and the start of your own fame?
(Fire crackling)
<U+266A>
<U+266A>
Well, what do you say?
(Floorboard creaks)
(Door creaks open)
(Gasps and exhales)
(Fire crackles)
<U+266A>
(Waves lap at the shore, flames billow in the distance)
<U+266A>
<U+266A>
I say yes.
I will fight with you.
I will fight with you against my brother.

							Last season on \"Vikings\"...
SEER: The gods desire you to have a great future.
He's found a new way to navigate the sea.
Great towns, and cities, and treasures, and a new God.
(Panicked screaming, swords slash)
Why have you not killed this one?
RAGNAR: I forbid it.
ROLLO: How can you forbid it, little brother, we are equals.
EARL HARALDSON: You understand that all this belongs to me.
LAGERTHA: In my dreams, we are always together.
RAGNAR: What does a man do?
He look after his family.
And?
He fights.
(Weapons clang, fighting grunts)
SIGGY: Hail, Earl Ragnar!
ALL: Hail, Earl Ragnar!
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
We shall have more ships to go West, for that is our future.
Why did the gods make me Earl, yet kill my son?
We can have more sons.
Have we not tried?
KONG HORIK: Ragnar Lothbrok!
King Horik, how can I be of help?
There is a Jarl in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.
He threatens me.
JARL BORG: Are you the emissaries from King Horik?
You're wasting your time.
It's my land and I want it returned to me.
King Horik resists your claim.
SIGGY: (Shrieking) No!
GILDA: I am going to die.
You are not going to die. What is it that the gods want?
SEER: To take something from you.
ASLAUG: I am Princess Aslaug, my mother was the shield-maiden Brunhilde.
Shall I tell Lagertha, your wife?
If you really want to be a great man, you need me as much as I need you.
What is it you really want?
The death of your brother and the start of your own fame?
I'm carrying your child.
I will fight with you against my brother.
__
RAGNAR: I've had no message from my brother, but I still believe in my heart that he will not betray me, for he has no reason.
Who needs a reason for betrayal?
One must always think the worst, Ragnar, even of your own kin.
That way, you avoid too much disappointment in life.
(Bird cries)
(Harsh wind blows)
(Wind whistles)
(Expresses water forcefully from nose)
(Horn bellows in the distance)
(Horse snorts nervously)
There is the treacherous one.
I was right, Ragnar.
(Inhales forcefully)
I was right.
<U+266A> More, give me more <U+266A>
<U+266A> Give me more <U+266A>
<U+266A> If I had a heart I could love you <U+266A>
<U+266A> If I had a voice I would sing <U+266A>
<U+266A> After the night when I wake up <U+266A>
<U+266A> I'll see what tomorrow brings <U+266A>

Rider approaching!
(Horse nickers and snorts)
What is it you want?
ARNE: I'm here on behalf of Ragnar Lothbrok.
I want to speak to his brother.
JARL BORG: Then speak.
Rollo, you and I fought together many times.
I don't suppose you've forgotten.
I think of you as a brother... but over there is your real brother, your own flesh and blood.
Are you sure you want to raise your axe against him?
Did Ragnar send you?
(Exhales)
What answer shall I give him?
(Exhales slowly)
Tell him I shall answer him with blood.

FLOKI: (Groans weakly)
(Wind blows)
KING HORIK: Without being defeated, we have grown weary of the slaughter of our young men.
So, Jarl Borg, I offer you... one third of the profits from the disputed lands.
Unless you continue to dispute my claim to it.
I would rather go back fighting, than receive such scant justice.
(Weary, frustrated sigh)
So, you'll not accept my fair offer?
No.
Why do we continue looking inwards?
(Shouts)
Why?!
Why do we fight each other about this piece or that piece of land?
Why are we not looking outwards to the West?
If we raided together, we would not need to fight amongst ourselves.
We would not need to kill anymore of our young folk.
But instead, offer them land, land that they can farm.
WARRIOR: (Quietly)
He speaks the truth.
My mind tends the same way as Ragnar's.
It is my intention to join with him and sail West.
What do you say, Jarl Borg?
Yes, I will raid with you, and so I accept your offer.
(Warriors talk quietly)
Not that you'd care, brother, but your niece, Gyda, is dead.
Time to go home.
(Spits in disgust, groans)
(Water churns)
(Shouts of surprise in the distance)
(Cries of excitement)
(Chain clanks)
(Torstein grunts with effort)
(Women weep openly)
Floki! Floki!
Don't die. Please don't die.
WOMAN: What's happened to them?!
TOWNSPEOPLE: (Shout angrily)
One Eye died.
Arne?!
Rollo killed him.
And Floki may not survive for he is so badly wounded.
LAGERTHA: This was not your quarrel.
You should not have become involved.
Look what has happened!
No man can walk through life without things happening to him, Lagertha.
You chose.
Yes. I chose, and Rollo chose.
And Rollo's choice led to all this!
BJORN: Don't argue you two.
I am weary and I'm blood-sickened, and that is the truth.
(Bites food)
(Quietly)
Who is Aslaug?
(Grunts angrily)
(Plate strikes floor)
Stop.
Who is Aslaug?
She's a Gotaland princess.
We met her over there.
You just met her?
SIGGY: (Warningly)
Lagertha.
What has the boy told you?
What did you tell her, boy?
LAGERTHA: It doesn't matter what Bjorn says.
What do you say?
I say...
(Chairs crash)
we should not wash our dirty clothes in front of others.
(Water splashes and drips)
(Doors crash open)
Ungh!
Ungh!
(Object smashes)
Did you have s*x with her?
Yes, I had s*x with her.
(Object clatters)
How many times?!
Once.
Ungh!
(Struggling grunts)
(Panting)
I don't love her.
(Sharp gasp)
How can I make you let this go?
Never see her again.
Done.
Never again.
(Passionate gasp)
BJORN: Why are there such problems between you?
RAGNAR: You know why.
But I don't want there to be problems.
Can't you just say sorry for what you've done?
(Laughs) It's not so easy with your mother.
And what will happen to Rollo?
RAGNAR: I cannot judge my own brother.
We will have an assembly and the Law-Giver will judge.
We will take Rollo up to the Law Rock and that is where his fate will be decided.
What's that you have?
A gold coin. From England.
You see?
It even has King Aelle's face upon it.
So it's worth a fortune?
(Townspeople chatter, seagulls cry)
(Approaching footsteps)
TORSTEIN: What do you want?
To talk to him.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
(Whispers)
Rollo...
Rollo, it's me.
Don't bother.
You cannot warm up a dead man.
(Angry shouting and jeering)
MAN: He is without honor!
MAN 2: Kill him!
WOMEN: I spit on you!
MAN AND WOMAN: Traitor! Traitor!
WOMAN 2: Now he'll pay for what he's done!
WOMAN 3: Kill him!
MAN 2: Traitor! Traitor!
WOMAN 4: Kill him!
WOMAN 5: Shame on you!
(Bangs staff)
LAW-GIVER: People, as your Law-Giver, I have been asked to determine the fate of this man.
This man chose to fight with our enemies.
Chose to fight against his brother.
MAN: Traitor!
LAW-GIVER: He killed many of our sons, brothers, fathers.
What hope is there for him?
TOWNSPEOPLE: (Angry jeers)
TORSTEIN: He has no defense!
MAN: He has no defense!
LAW-GIVER: This man deserves to die.
TOWNSPEOPLE: Yeah!
We all know that.
But... I have decided to spare him.
(Shouts of disagreement)
LAW-GIVER: I have taken the advice of the gods.
If they had wanted him dead, he would have died in battle.
But they spared him.
He came forward and threw himself upon the mercy of his brother.
He behaved in an interesting and unexpected way, and therefore, I conclude... that the gods have made their own judgment, which I cannot overturn.
LAW-GIVER: I therefore order this man be set free.
CROWD: (Shouts angrily)
MAN: Kill the traitor!
TORSTEIN: We should kill him anyway. You are the Earl!
No. We must obey the law.
Who is the Law-Giver? Just an ordinary man.
Not when he stands on the Sacred Stone.
(Ships creak, dog barks, seagulls cry)
(Goats bleat, geese honk)
(Sighs heavily)
I wanted to step out of your shadow.
You understand, don't you?
But when I stepped out of it, there was... there was no sunlight, no sunlight at all.
(Ships creaks, seagulls cry)
(Door creaks open)
What are you doing?
Leaving.
Everyone hates me here... with good reason.
I have betrayed them.
There is no point in my staying.
But you are going to leave and not even say goodbye to me?
I thought you would prefer it that way.
Do you really know me so little?
I have nothing to offer you.
It would have been better for you, for me, for everyone if I had been executed.
So you take no account of the gods?
What would you say the gods have offered you?
A lifetime of humiliation.
SIGGY: No! That is not it!
The gods have offered you a chance to be reborn, to be redeemed, to gain Valhalla.
That is what they have offered you.
But you, you want to run away.
You want to hide in a hole somewhere.
Where else can I go?
Why do you have to go anywhere?
(Birds chirp and cry, fire crackles)
RAGNAR: Gyda, I have come to say goodbye to you properly.
I have been thinking about you, about when you were small.
You were so lively, you could run as swiftly as the wind.
You were like quick-silver.
But then, before I knew it, you stopped running here and there and everywhere and you became still.
At 12-years-old, you had the stillness and the calm of a fine woman.
What children you would have produced!
What joy that would have brought to all of us.
Dear child, Gyda, you are not gone because you are always in my heart.
They say that a man must love his sons more, but a man can be jealous of his sons, and his daughter can always be the light in his life.
I know very well that you are with the gods, but I will wait here awhile, and if you want to come and talk to me, then come and talk, and I will gently stroke your long and beautiful hair once again with my peasant hands.
(Waves lap gently)
(Waves lap against the ship)
(Ship creaks)
(Low hum of chatter, wind howls)

BJORN: Father!
Father!
RAGNAR: What?
BJORN: There's someone coming.
(Buzz of excited chatter)
CAPTAIN: Keep steady! Take the oars!
Pull in the ropes!
(Buzz of excited chatter)
RAGNAR: You must believe me, I had no idea.
I did not ask her to come.
(Sheep bleats)
(Low hum of chatter)
(Excited whispers)
(Boisterous chatter)
(Music fill the hall)
(Goat bleats)
Bjorn told me that your mother was the shield-maiden, Brunhilde, of whom we've all heard?
It's true.
Although she died when I was very young.
And your father?
My father was Sigurd.
Sigurd...?
Just Sigurd?
ASLAUG: No, I mean the Sigurd who, according to the sagas, killed the dragon Fafnir.
Then your father is also a hero.
People talk about him, it's true, and I'm proud that he was my father.
But I never knew him.
What about your parents?
LAGERTHA: Hmm.
They were just farmers.
Surely nobody is just a farmer.
Believe me, princess, that is exactly what some people are, and are happy to be.
Forgive me.
Do you remember me, Bjorn?
Do you remember we stood in front of the Tree of Life?
It wasn't Yggdrasil. It was just a tree.
ASLAUG: You're right. We both know that.
It creates a bond between us.
BJORN: I don't think so.
We don't have any bond.
I don't want any bond with you.
(Uneasy silence)
BJORN: Why don't you just tell her that she has to leave soon?
She can't stay here.
She is carrying my child.
She brings unhappiness and difficulty.
Can't you see that? Are you blind?
I know it is hard for you to accept, but unhappiness is more common than happiness.
Who told you you should be happy?
You've come to an age where you must be grow up and be responsible about such things.
When I was your age, I had many friends.
All are dead.
The happiness is neither here nor there.
SIGGY: How much do you know about this woman?
Only what Bjorn told me, which was not much.
He did not wish to be disloyal to his father.
(Sighs heavily) I did not know she was carrying his child, though.
And you believe it?
LAGERTHA: Ragnar believes it.
What of all her stories of Brunhilde and Sigurd?
I suppose so.
She is clearly different from us.
(Women chatter nearby)
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I must do what is right for my son.
(Water splashes)
(Geese honk, people chatter)
Oh, Floki!
I'm not dead yet, Bjorn.
No thanks to you, Ragnar.
RAGNAR: Oh. Say what you'd like about me, I'm just glad that the gods were stupid enough to save you.
FLOKI: The gods... and Helga.
You must regain your strength.
There's much to do. A whole fleet of boats to be built.
You and I have seen nothing yet. Our journeys have just begun.
FLOKI: It's true!
I thought I was dead and while I was dead, I was dreaming of other places, the places that you and I shall sail to, Ragnar.
(Laboured breath)
(Exhales in pain)
Rest.
Come on, boy.
(Wind blows fiercely)
(Loud chatter fills the hall)
(Fire crackles)
(Doors bang open)
BJORN: Floki!
MAN: Hey, Floki!
FLOKI: Hello, Bjorn.
MAN: Floki!
(Doors latches)
(Loud chatter resumes)
(Everybody quiets down)
ASLAUG: I hope you will accept what I have chosen and prepared for you?
(Hushed whispers and laughter)
WOMAN: Generous!
I did not expect you to go to so much trouble.
It is no trouble, if it is pleasing to you.
(People laugh and chatter)
To tell you the truth, I did not imagine you could cook!
I can't. My women cooked, I just bought the ingredients.
Looking at both of you here, in my home...
I see no reason why you two should not get on together.
You two are very different, yet both strong.
I have heard that similar arrangements exist all over this country.
What arrangements?
That an Earl can live with more than one woman.
In fact, it is not unusual.
It works to the benefit of everyone, especially the children.
Of both marriages, of course.
It's true. I know of many such instances.
Yes.
Is that what you're suggesting?
If I were, what would you say?
I'm sorry, but this woman is carrying my child.
I must take care of her. You must accept.
When we lost our unborn son, it broke my heart.
I had failed and I will not fail again.
I cannot turn this woman away.
I have to take care of my child.
(Sighs heavily)
Don't forget the axe.
You are leaving then?
Of course I'm leaving.
TORSTEIN: Is Bjorn going with you?
That's up to Bjorn.
Bjorn, you have a big choice to make.
I admire your mother. We all do.
But you have to stay with your father.
If you don't, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
Remember, your father is Ragnar Lothbrok.
(Townspeople chatter)
Bjorn.
You have to choose.
Say it now.
I... I choose my father.
(Emotional)
Very well.
(Tearful, shaky breaths)
(Light kiss)
(Shaky, emotional breaths)
(Quiet whimper)
(Shaky, emotional breaths)

(Horse whinnies)
Move!
(Hooves thud)
(Water splashes)
(Galloping hard)
(Cart rattles to a stop)
You're really going to abandon me without even saying a word?
You insult and humiliate me.
I have no choice but to leave you and divorce you.
I don't want you to go.
It's fate.
(Running footsteps)
(Panting)
I've changed my mind. I'm coming with you.
(Panting)
(Emotional exhale)
(Shaky, emotional breath)
(Shakily)
Look after your mother.
(Emotional exhale)
LAGERTHA: Come on.
(Sniffs)
Move on.

Well, I've been busy like a dwarf, building your new boats, Ragnar Lothbrok, even in the ice and the snow.
So busy, yet he still have so much time to complain.
FLOKI: The boats are nearly finished.
I think we all want to know where we'll be raiding this summer.
Every year, all your people wonder when you will order another raid West and every year you disappoint them.
I've even heard some people say that Earl Ragnar is becoming like Earl Haraldson.
Let me put their minds at ease.
You should.
Welcome, everyone.
As you all know, it has taken a long time to prepare ourselves.
To build our ships, and to replace the young men that we lost to the plague.
But now, now we are ready, and this summer we shall finally go West again.
(Enthusiastic cheers erupt)
Yay! Yeah!
We will return to England, for that land was so generous to us the last time.
But this time, we shall not go alone.
For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.
And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for awhile, explore it, maybe even winter there.
Who knows?
But, I tell you, these are interesting times.
The world is changing and we must change with it.
We must act together, for everyone's sake.
And now that I have put your minds to rest, who is hungry?
TOWNSFOLK: (Cheering and clapping)
(Light kiss)
(Hall buzzes with excited chatter)
(Weary exhale)
(Geese honk, goats bleat)
(Low moan)
(Sighs heavily)
(Water splashes as ice breaks)
(Gasping and sputtering)
(Gasping)
(Hall buzzes with excited chatter)
Thank you.
I've never seen you before.
What is your name?
My name is Hild, my lord.
Where are you from?
Upsalla.
Upsalla.
Thank you.
What were you talking about with her?
We were talking about movements in the shield-wall.
Girl, bring me some more food.
I have to eat for two.
Yes, my lady.
How old are you?
I don't know.
Old enough, I'd say.
Be careful who you choose to be familiar with.
Yes, my Lady Aslaug.
(Door slams shut)
What is it?
What is what?
You...
You are acting very...strangely.
Oh, you think it is strange for a pregnant woman to want her husband to be supportive and kind?
No.
Then why do you think I'm acting \"strangely\"?
I don't know.
You don't know that you're flirting with other women and showing them you want to bed them?
I am not doing that.
(Grunts)
You're saying such things because of your condition.
(Coldly furious)
My \"condition\"?!
Tell your beautiful mother that I am not doing what she thinks.
(Ragnar gasps)
Yes, you are. Women know these things.
I know it especially, because I have certain gifts.
(Snorts)
Gifts?
I see things others cannot.
Ah!
You mean you are a Volva?
Seeress? I may be.
They say that Volvas practice forbidden sexual rites.
Shall I stay awake?
The fact is, you want to sleep with that girl, even though she is barely above a slave girl.
That is such an insult to me.
I do not want to sleep with that girl, whatever her name is.
Good night, little one.
And now I'm going to sleep.
I won't let you sleep until I have told you this: I will bear you another son.
If you like, you can feel him stirring in my belly.
But, because you treat me like an idiot, I make this prophecy.
My father killed the dragon Fafnir, and our new son will be born with the image of the serpent in his eye.
This much I know.
SEER: What is it you want?
The gods have given me sons, as they promised.
But I want to know what the future holds. what will become of them?
The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok will be spoken of as long as men have tongues to speak.
They will enjoy that much fame?
One of them will marry the daughter of a king.
Another will discover and sail around the sea that has no tides.
All this, and more, have I foreseen.
Then they will have more fame than I, their father?
(Chuckles softly)
What about Bjorn?
What about my son Bjorn?
What of him?
Is he alive?
It was of him I was speaking.
Will I ever see him again?
You ask too many questions.
I have said enough.
(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)
(Geese honk)
See for yourself. Good salted fish.
Not today.
You're a disgrace.
(Flame crackles)
I have lost everything!
My sons, my husband, finally my daughter.
I am not going to lose you.
Yesterday your brother spoke of the summer's raid.
He's going west again, with King Horik.
You must ask him to take you with him.
(Pathetically)
Look at me!
You will look better if you have something to believe in.
I am giving you a choice, Rollo.
Go and speak with your brother, or...
(Blade scrapes)
or take this blade, push it into your ribs right now.
Stay in hell for all eternity.
(Flesh sizzles)
(Stifled gasps)
(Stifled grunts of pain)
ASLAUG: One day, Hvitserk, you will ride a horse, just like this.
(Approaching footsteps)
Ragnar.
(Goats bleat)
You should all leave.
Come on, boys.
Ubbe, go with your mother.
I said everyone.
Well, I just thought...
Everyone.
Well, are you going to take a seat?
(Sighs)
So where have you been for so long, brother?
Carrying around my heavy heart, cursing the gods, cursing myself, and then drinking ale until I almost forgot everything.
So why are you here now?
I am your brother.
You chose to fight against me.
I remember when we were boys, we often fought against each other.
Isn't that always the way with brothers?
They hate and love each other all the time.
You could have killed me, like you killed One-Eye.
I could never have killed you.
Tell me, why should I ever trust you again?
Because I ask you to.
Shouldn't you be asking for forgiveness after everything you have done?
I ask only for the opportunity to regain your respect, to fight beside you again in battle.
I have nothing.
You have suffered.
But many people suffered more because of what you did.
Let me think on it.
Then I'll give you my decision.
(Sniffs)
You broke my heart.
(Metallic clanking, steam hisses)
MEN AND WOMEN: (Fighting grunts)
MAN: Good!
(Weapons clank, slash, and thud)
MAN: Use your fear!
Not bad for a shield-maiden.
(Men and women grunt)
(Weapons clang and thud)
Do you ever miss England?
No.
(Weapons clank, warriors grunt)
Sometimes.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
I don't want to stay here with the old people.
Good.
Perhaps you will come in useful.
(Lunging grunt, weapons clank)
We will need the help of all the gods, including yours.
(Weapons clank, hard blows)
Ungh!
Ooh!
(Panting)
(Weapons clank, Athelstan grunts)
(Gasps)
(Weapons clank)
(Men and women grunt)
MAN: That's better!
MAN: Yah!
WOMAN: Ungh!
It is one thing to use a weapon, but another to kill.
Ungh!
Never hesitate.
(Horn bellows)
RAGNAR: King Horik!
Welcome indeed.
Earl Ragnar, my great friend.
I heard you came by horse. Where are your ships?
My ships are being prepared. I could not wait.
I have waited an eternity already.
Ja. I said to my sons, hmm, I have to set off.
I cannot even wait for the ice to melt.
My ships will arrive soon enough.
And I look forward to getting to know your sons and introducing mine.
There is someone here that you will well remember.
(Approaching footsteps)
FLOKI: Come here, Ubbe.
I can see, King Horik, that you're not too... delighted to see me, but I hope you're not surprised.
We all made an agreement to raid together and I've come to honor it.
The last time we met, Jarl Borg, I had the distasteful task of burying many of my kinsmen and friends.
And for the past four years, I've been paying you profits from my lands.
But still, it is true, I am not surprised to see you.
Good.
Is this not Rollo, the brother who fought against us?
Yes.
And you spared his life?
The gods spared his life.
What is your decision?
I accept you back, Rollo.
I acknowledge you as my brother, but I forbid you to raid with us.
I accept your judgment.
(Sighs uneasily)
(Music plays)
(Rowdy laughter and chatter)
MAN: Drink to the gods!
(Laughs)
JARL BORG: King Horik.
(Ale pours)
(Chatter and laughter fills hall)
(Music continues playing)
KING HORIK: Ahh!
I have to tell you, Princess Aslaug, it is the greatest privilege and honor to be seated beside you, the daughter of Sigurd.
Thank you, King Horik.
Such a compliment, from a man like you, is always welcome.
Mm. Oh, it is true, I have also slain dragons, just like your father.
Unfortunately, like most men, the dragons were only inside my head.
(Laughs)
How old are you, Ari?
Seventeen. Nearly eighteen.
Will this be your first raid?
Yes. I can't wait to prove myself in battle.
I want my father to be proud of me.
I have a son about your age.
Where is he?
I would like to meet him.
I do not know where he is.
That is by his choice.
I should never have mentioned him. Drink.
I have made a decision.
I do not wish Jarl Borg to raid with us.
But we had an agreement. Why not?
Why do you not want your brother beside you?
Because you don't trust him enough.
It is the same for me with Jarl Borg.
I cannot bring myself to trust him completely.
You must inform him of our decision.
(Loud buzz of chatter)
(Fire crackles)
(Sighs heavily)
Skol.
Skol.
MAN: Come look!
(Water splashes and churns)
Are you jealous?
Hmph! They won't even make it out of the Fjord.
(Laughs)
They are beautiful, King Horik.
(Pleased)
Mm-hm.
Jarl Borg, thank you for waiting.
So... when do we set sail?
Forgive me, Jarl Borg, but we have decided not to seek your help.
I thought we had an agreement.
It is not my desire to break that agreement.
Believe me, I wish it to remain intact.
But on this occasion...
On this occasion?
On this occasion, the silver thread is slit, the golden cup breaks and the pail is smashed at the spring.
I know much about what happens here that you do not.
I know things about Ragnar Lothbrok you do not know.
I knew his first wife, Lagertha, and their son Bjorn.
I know his strengths, and I know his weaknesses.
Why should I need to know his weaknesses?
Because he is your his ally.
It is always a strength to know the weaknesses of your friends, is it not?
I might be interested in what you know.
But how do I know you and I can trust each other?
(Fire crackles)
Hmm?
(Ale pours)
Your brother gives with one hand and takes away with the other.
How many times must you suffer his injustices?
(Strums a chord)
If only you had stayed strong, we would have overcome.
And now he does with you as he wishes.
It's terrible to witness the state into which you have fallen... you, Rollo, the greatest warrior.
What do you want?
Abandon your brother for good.
You will never be anything here.
Why would you stay? What can you find?
Myself.
Yourself?
(Laughs)
Yourself?!
(Slaps knee)
(Chuckles softly)
If you want to find yourself...
(Hard punch, chair crashes)
(Grunting and panting)
You're a fool.
(Spits)
Yes.
But someday I hope to be wise.

I love you.
Good boy.
(Sighs heavily)
Farewell, my wife.
And you, Sigurd.
We will make a sacrifice to Thor, but I believe you shall cross the sea safely.
I shall get word to you as soon as I can.
I will miss you... your pride.
So will I.

You asked to see me?
Yes, sit.
We have not made friends. It is my fault.
But, if you want to, we can be friends now.
After all, we a family and Ragnar has forgiven his brother.
I would be honored to be considered your friend.
Let's not fool one another.
You were once where I am now.
Perhaps you wish to return to this status?
If so, I don't blame you.
But in the meantime, let's not be enemies.
Women should stick together more.
That's true.
And we should rule!
(Laughs)
All things would be better.
Friend.
Friend.
We've been blown miles off course, who knows where we are?
The gods know, Priest.
What I want to know... Where are all the ships?
How many do you see?
Only four.
Some of the others may have been scattered.
Or they all might all have foundered.
(Ship creaks)

They defeated a large force of our men.
They are here.

(Foliage crunching underfoot, morning doves cry)
Ragnar: What is that place?
Athelstan: It's a Christian church, a minster.
A large one. It may be Winchester.
Is it important?
If it is Winchester, Saint Birinus is buried there.
It's a place of great pilgrimage.
And will there be treasure there?
(Chortles) Yes. A lot of treasure.
Floki: (Happy) Hmm!
(Grasses crunch underfoot)
King Ecbert: There's no surprise to me that these Northmen have arrived in Wessex.
After I heard about their raids into Northumbria, I realized it was only a matter of time before they came ashore here.
When I lived at the court of the Emperor Charlemagne, these Northmen had already emerged from their lairs to attack parts of his empire.
I was with Charlemagne's party at a harbor town in Southern Gaul.
And as we sat eating supper a fleet of pirates attacked the harbor.
There was some confusion about their identity, but from the build of their ships and their speed through the water, the Emperor recognized them at once as Northmen.
After a lightning attack...
(Sharp exhale)
They made their escape.
The Emperor's men took up the chase, but they were soon out-sailed.
And now it is our turn to deal with these ruffians, these pagans.
But deal with them we shall... 
And must.
Aethelwulf?
Yes, Father.
King Ecbert: I put it in your hands to work with our Ealdormen to raise an army.
In the meantime, we shall send spies and others to observe the size of the raiding party, and their intentions.
These Northmen never like to venture far from their ships and they prefer not to be drawn into pitched battle.
Let us not be afraid, but rather watchful.

He refuses to accept or acknowledge my love for him.
Lagertha: You don't love my son.
You don't love anyone, Sigvard.
You don't know how to.
(Hard slap) Aghhh!

Ragnar: Who was this?
Athelstan: It must be Saint Birinus.
King Horik: Here! There's more!
Ragnar: You keep talking to me like I know what a Saint is.
Athelstan: A Saint is a man who has lived a particularly holy life, performed some miracle, or been martyred killed for their beliefs.
King Horik: It's all gold!
But I am dead. What use can I be?
(Chuckles)
Christians believe that the bones can still exert benediction.
Can perform miracles.
What is a miracle?
Miracles are things... which are impossible to do.

(Raucous laughter)
(Objects clatter, warriors chatter)
- Warrior 1: Help me!
Warrior 2: Here!
(Objects clatter)
(Arrow whooshes, bishop groans in pain)
Vikings: (Cheering) Woo!
(Boisterous laughter)
Bishop Swithern: (Weakly)
Domini, creatura tue, qua tuo sanguine redemisti... 
- Warrior: Don't kill him, Floki.
Bishop Swithern: Penitent... 
(Arrow whooshes) Ungh!
Vikings: (Cheer loudly)
Bishop Swithern: Penitent me.
Floki: Is he still talking? Tough old goat.
King Horik: Erlendur, quiet him. Right in his mouth.
Warrior: What's he doing?
Warrior 2: Out of the way.
(Axe clatters)
Bishop Swithern: (Weak, mumbled praying)
(Inhales sharply)
Deus tippi benidicas.
Suffer no more, but trust in thy salvation.
(Bishop gasps, blade scrapes)
(Sighs)
(Boisterous chatter resumes)
(Knife clinks)
(Chatter and laughter fills great hall)
Bjorn: Mother, why would you allow him to do that to you?
What are you talking about?
Your husband, Earl Sigvard, I saw him!
(Warningly) Bjorn, please.
Please what?
Has he hit you before?
Will you let him hit you again?
It will never happen again.
If it does, I'll kill him.
I said it won't.
What would Ragnar say?
What has it to do with your father?
Nothing!
Sometimes I think of him.
I miss him. I can't help it.
Sigvard: Skol! (Laughing)
Of course not. You're his son.
You must always be proud.
As should you for being his wife!
Sigvard and men: (Laugh and chatter)
(Laughter, low hum of chatter)
(Sighs heavily)
(Townsfolk chatter, children shout playfully)
(Sheep bleat)
(Hurried footsteps)
(Exhales)
(Water splashes)
(Baby coos softly)
Siggy: Another son?
Aslaug: Yes.
What is his name?
Sigurd, after my father.
(Sigurd coos softly)
Sigurd snake-in-the-eye.
Soldier: (Shouts) Guard the gate!
Lord Eadric: Your Majesty, you have heard of the attack on Winchester?
Of course.
I grieve.
Bishop Edmund: The martyrdom of my fellow bishop,
Bishop Swithern, a fine Christian.
King Ecbert: Praise be to God.
Lord Eadric: There are those who ask why we did not do more to protect our brothers and sisters at such an important site.
Are there?
My kingdom is very large.
There are many important sites.
Could I protect all of them? No.
Did I want to discover where the pagans would strike?
Yes.
For now I know where they are.
Bishop Edmund: So...
Bishop Swithern was a necessary sacrifice.
As a man of God, I assumed he welcomed the opportunity for martyrdom.
Or do you disagree?
Bishop Edmund: Oh no, sire.
All of the cloth would welcome martyrdom in the cause of our faith, service of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Good.
Because I'm going to offer you precisely that same opportunity, my Lord Bishop, and, I trust, very soon.
(Nervous sigh)
Lord Eadric: (Sighs heavily)
(Water churns and splashes)
(Hammering)
Warrior: Look at these, nice and strong.
Tight enough?
I have something for you, Athelstan.
Don't you want it?
Are these not the images of your God?
I told you before, and I will tell you again: My God is Odin, the all father.
I know you told me.
Only... I don't believe you.
And this? Ragnar gave me this.
Wearing a dog-turd doesn't make you a dog.
Oh.
I have something else for you.
The hand of your holy man, I believe.
(Giggles)
Ragnar: So tell me, how do you find England?
Horik: It is a pleasant land, rich with treasure.
You are right. This land is rich.
But here... here is the real treasure!
(Inhales deeply)
Earth? Have you not seen?
Everywhere we go, there are crops.
There is food growing.
I am a farmer and the son of a farmer, and this is what I understand.
Compared to our poor countries, where it is hard to farm, hard to live.
Here, it is easy.
If we lived here, we could feed everybody.
There would be no hunger.
I like your thinking, but here is my question: Will the Saxons simply invite us to live among them, hmm?
(Loud cheering and applause)

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
(Music and applause fill the great hall)
Man: Jarl Borg!
Man 2: To your new bride!
(Applause)
Man 3: A fine choice this day!
Jarl Borg: Thank you!
(Loud cheering and applause)
Man 4: A fine choice, my lord!
(Excited buzz of chatter and applause)
(Quiets down)
So I am married for the second time.
As most of you know, my first marriage lasted less than an hour, because my own brother poisoned the drinks that day.
Of course, the same thing can never happen twice, so let the wine be poured.
Men and women: (Cheering) Yeah! Here, here!
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)
Now who will be the first to drink in celebration?
I will.
No! No, I could not bear it. Not a second time.
Let me taste the wine.
(Gulping)
(Uneasy silence)
It's quite all right.
Skol!
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)
Jarl Borg: I have something else important to say.
I don't wish to dampen the celebrations but you all know that the agreement between myself, King Horik, and Ragnar Lothbrok has been broken.
They have gone raiding west without me, without us, which is an insult not only to myself, but to all of you, and now also to my wife, and to my wife's family.
(Murmurs of agreement)
I have to do something about this insult.
Frankly, I blame King Horik more for what has happened, but at the same time, consider what is happening to Earl Ragnar's lands.
He has abandoned them to the care of his wife and his drunken brother.
(Laughter)
In order to punish those who have insulted me and my family, I declare today that I will seek vengeance against Ragnar Lothbrok.
By all our gods, I swear that we will seize all his lands and that I will repay his brother's treachery with the axe.
All: (Cheer in agreement)
(Birds chirping)
(Foliage rustles underfoot)
(Hooves plod, horses snort softly)
(Horses snort and whinny)
Bishop Edmund: Who can speak to us?
I can.
I have been sent here by Ecbert, King of Wessex.
The king regrets your attack on the holy church at Winchester.
He wonders how much longer you intend to remain in his kingdom?
(Nervously clears throat)
Ragnar: Well, that depends.
Bishop Edmund: Upon what?
Ragnar: Upon what he'll offer us to leave... or what he'll offer us to stay.
Stay?
Ragnar: Yes, we want to make peace with the king.
Peace.
(Tries to clear throat)
So we don't have to kill any more of you.
I will relay your message to the king.
(Floki giggles)
(Claps twice)
King Horik: (In Old Norse) Wait!
(Hard slash) Ughhh!
(Giggles)
(Slashing blows, grunts of effort)
Bishop Edmund: (Struggling grunts)
Vikings: (Laughing)
Floki: (Giggles)
Bishop Edmund: (Collapses) Agh!
Vikings: (Laughing)
(Horse whinnies, hooves thunder)
Sigvard: Not hungry, Bjorn?
No.
Sigvard: Any reason?
No reason.
Sigvard: Are you unhappy?
What can I do to make you happy?
Shall I raid one of my unsuspecting neighbours, so you can show off your fighting skills, and maybe slaughter them all?
Show that you are truly the son of Ragnar Lothbrok?!
Sigvard and men: (Laugh)
Sigvard: No, believe me,
I do not like to see you so solemn.
So tell me, what can I do?
Bjorn: You can let me go live in a cabin in the mountains.
Sigvard: By yourself? In the mountains?
Bjorn: Yes. I'd like to test myself.
Get away from all this. All these servants!
All these people doing everything for us.
I want to know what is essential to life.
What is really important.
Will you let me?
No, of course not.
I am the Earl here.
What would folk think if I let my beloved stepson starve or freeze to death in some mountain pigsty?
Sigvard and men: (Laugh)
Sigvard: You understand that, don't you, my boy?
In any case, I have solemnly sworn to Lagertha that I shall take care of you, and I will.
(Fire crackles in the silence)

Siggy: Rollo! (Sighs)
Siggy: Rollo, wake up!
Rollo: (Exasperated) What? What is it?
Siggy: There are boats!
Rollo: (Sighs)
Siggy: Who are they?
Rollo: I think I can guess.
Go back to the town.
Find anyone who can fight, anyone who can hold a weapon.
We're under attack.
(Water churns)
Aslaug: Rollo, what is it? What is happening?
Rollo: Jarl Borg! He has come back to attack us.
Aslaug: Jarl Borg?
Rollo: (Panting) I'm sure it is him.
Ragnar and King Horik broke their agreement with him.
He has returned to gain his revenge.
What are we going to do?
(Panting) What do you think we're going to do?
We're going to fight.
Aslaug: Come. Go! Go!
(Panicked chatter)
Rollo: Torfin! Olaf! One of you on each flank.
Help with the barricades.
Ragnar has taken all of the best fighting men.
Look what we have left!
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
Not you. You are not a shield-maiden.
You're not...
Lagertha?
Siggy, I need you to go back to the great hall.
Find Princess Aslaug and her children and take them up into the mountains.
And then what?
Wait.
For what?
For whatever the gods have decided is about to happen.
Now go!
Man: Roll them in there!
Woman: Fasten them on as quick as you can!
(Running footfalls)
(Barrels clatter)

Raise an army, observe the size of the raiding party and their intention.
This land is rich, but here... Is the real treasure.
Earth.
We want to make peace with the king, so we don't have to kill any more of you.
You're my wife, you should be at my side.
Lagertha: Agh!
Bjorn: Why would you allow him to do that?
It will never happen again.
If it does, I will kill him.

Rollo: We'll stay here!
Aslaug: No, stop!
I'm not staying there! It looks disgusting.
Rollo: Princess, it will be winter soon enough.
If we have nowhere to live, no roof over our heads, no hearth fire to warm us, we will all perish.
Surely we can find some Earl's hall -
somewhere more inviting and comfortable.
(Sighs)
For my children.
And if we are to find such a place, it would only take a few days before someone took the news to Jarl Borg.
(Baby cries)
(Clucks tongue) (Sighs heavily)
Siggy: We will survive this.
Believe me, you and I can survive this.
It will make you stronger.
It will make your sons stronger, also.
Jarl Borg: People of Kattegat -
I am Jarl Borg of Gotaland, your new ruler.
I promise you I only came here to seek justice.
Earl Ragnar broke his sacred promise he made to me and therefore, by our laws, he forfeited the right to rule.
Townspeople: (Murmurs of concern)
In me, you will find a fair ruler; Kattegat is an important trading station and I mean to see it flourish.
Townspeople: (Murmur) Man: Of course.
Seer: (Low groan)
There will be no protest against my rule and there will be no law here except mine.
Oever will deliver me the whereabouts of Ragnar's wife, his children, and his brother, will be paid his or her own weight in silver and gold.
From now on, only criminals will talk of Ragnar Lothbrok.
To all intents and purposes, Ragnar Lothbrok is dead.
(Door opens)
(Door creaks closed)
Why have you come?
I've come to ask you some questions.
Seer: Not too many.
I have no time to answer too many.
Then tell me this, wise one: Did you foresee what has happened here?
And, if so, did you warn the people?
I see what the gods allow me to see, and say what they allow me to say.
Then you saw nothing, or you said nothing?
Do you have any other questions?
I'd like to know what will happen to me, if, that is, the gods will allow you to say.
Yes, I can see...
And I see an eagle.
I see that an eagle hovers over you.
But I also see that you yourself are the eagle.
Jarl Borg: An eagle is a good sign.
Always in the sagas, a good sign.
An eagle, a soaring bird.
A good sign from the gods.
Is it not true, old man?
Seer: Yes, I see an eagle, and the eagle is your destiny, Jarl Borg.

Bishop Edmund: Sire, if we continue to do nothing, their depredations will only spread.
They've not removed themselves, nor yet sailed away, as we all prayed.
Ealdorman Werferth: Your army is collected, sire, and awaits your orders.
They expressed the desire to talk, so, first, we should talk.
Bishop Edmund: How are we to trust men like these who kill without conscience, who desecrate and pollute sacred places?
Ecbert: No, we cannot trust them.
Therefore, there will be an exchange of hostages before we begin.
Man: Hmm, wise.
Ealdorman Werferth: And who are we to deliver into their tender care?
Ecbert: My son, Aethelwulf.
Father?!
A hostage of the highest value is the safest hostage.
But I will not deliver you to them until they have first delivered to me a hostage of equal value to themselves.
Bishop Edmund: They are savages, heathens!
They do not put a value on any life.
Ecbert: Oh, I... I doubt that.
We are christians, but not so long ago we were also pagans.
And, when we were pagans, do you think we cared nothing for our families, our children?
But I swear to you, my son, I would never surrender you without your blessing and agreement.
Father, you know the answer to that: I place myself in your hands.
I am at your disposal.
Man: Well said, young man.

Aslaug: Hvitserk!
Siggy: Here, give me the baby.
Ubbe: (Laughs)
Hvitserk: Ubbe!
Shh, shh, shh...
Oh! Off him!
Everything is so dirty here.
You are safe here, and your children are safe here.
Aslaug: Safe?
They will all die of some disease.
Look at the boys, already so thin, so sickly.
I can't stay here! You have to stay here.
Look, I know this is not what you are used to, but you will get used to it.
(Baby fusses, settles)
Many of our people live like this.
Life is not a walk across an open field!

Ecbert: Now we are equal.
We can talk together honestly, man to man.
May I ask you a question, Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why do you not go home?
After the sack of the minster at Winchester, you surely have enough treasure.
And by staying, you've given me time to raise a large army.
I don't care about treasure.
I am a very uh... Curious man.
I want to see your lands, and I want to see how you farm them.
You see... I am really a farmer.
Are you saying that if I offer you some land, we could make a deal?
It's possible.
But I would want something in return.
You see, Ragnar Lothbrok, I am an ambitious man.
I have great plans.
And you and your warriors could help me to fulfill them.
(Horses snort, birds chirp)
Horik: What else did this King of Wessex have to say?
Ragnar: That he might offer us land.
Horik: And you believed him?

(Horn bellows in the distance)

Thorvard, welcome.
Thorvard: Thank you, my lord.
I bring grave news for Ragnar Lothbrok.
Your lands are lost, invaded by Jarl Borg.
Your family is fled, only the gods know where.
Now Jarl Borg lives in your great hall and rules in your place.
(bird cries)
(Frantic panting)
You're leaving?
Of course I am.
I must find my family.
Are you not coming?
I'm minded to stay here, Ragnar, to speak with this King Ecbert further.
I think he is afraid of us and will make some deal to our advantage.
Ragnar: You can't even speak their language.
How will you communicate?
Horik: If you will permit this man, Athelstan, to remain with me, he can do the talking.
Ragnar: Athelstan is a free man.
It is his choice.
Athelstan: If I can be of help to King Horik then I am happy to stay.
I am surprised to hear you say that...
For you know my family better than anyone.
You've always said how important these contacts are for the future and prosperity of all your people.
So is it not more important for me to remain here?
Are you sure you want to do this?
Then so be it.
Prepare the ships!
If you change your mind, your friends will be leaving at first light.
Horik: May Thor fill your sails, to the place of vengeance!

(Hooves thunder)
Yah! Come on!
Bjorn: Jarl Borg has invaded his lands while ragnar has been away.
He killed all who resisted.
Rollo, Princess Aslaug, Siggy, Princess Alsaug's children, they've all fled Kattegat.
Lagertha: I cannot believe it.
What are the gods thinking?
Bjorn: Ragnar will come back.
He will come back to fight for his lands and we must help him.
We can't.
But you used to-it's not Earl Sigvard's quarrel.
Why should he fight to restore Ragnar's lands?
Bjorn: You could ask him!
(Sighs angrily)
(Hooves thunder)
Rollo: There are several farming families who are willing to fight with us against Jarl Borg.
How many?
Twenty... Thirty warriors.
That's not enough.
No, not enough, at least to do battle.
But perhaps enough to torment.
We have to make sure that Jarl Borg never feels secure in his inheritance.
We can mount raids on his outposts, disrupt his supplies.
Sooner or later, my brother will return, and, in the meantime, our task is to keep his memory alive.
Why are you smiling?
(Sighs happily)
I am smiling because...
A year ago, you would not have spoken like this.
My brother forgave me, something I thought impossible.
When I searched my heart, I discovered that I always loved him.
That I'd grown to hate myself.
(Fire crackles)
(Goats bleat)
I'm sorry, you're tired.
You must want to sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
(Rollo gasps)
I want to feel alive.

(Door bangs open)
You're still a handsome woman, Lagertha.
I'll say that for you.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
As long as...
It has nothing to do with Ragnar Lothbrok, then talk away.
Of course it has to do with Ragnar.
Then I'm not interested.
(Belt clatters on floor)
Come into bed.
Lagertha: No. Not until we have talked.
I told you, woman, I don't want to talk about your ex-husband.
He used to own your body, but now I own it.
So, come to bed.
It would be in your interest to intervene in this affair.
How so?
Jarl Borg will bring his relations, his family, his people, from Gotaland and place them on your doorstep!
On our doorstep, wife!
After Ragnar, you will be next, don't you understand?
Forget Ragnar! Don't!
I am your husband!
Lagertha: (Struggling grunts)
(Muffled struggling grunts)
(Muffled struggling grunts)

Do you understand?

Helga: No, but I know where they are.
Siggy sent a boy to tell me, a farmer's son.
Take me there. Tomorrow.
After you have slept.
I shan't sleep.
Jorl Borg has taken away my sleep.
Unload!
Helga: What happened?
Thor was angry with us.
He beat his anvil and the waves grew ever taller, soaked the boats, and one went down, heavy with water.
We saw it, and heard the cries of the men hauled down into the deep.
And then, at first light, we saw another had vanished, storm wrecked, the men all drowned.
Thank the gods you're alive.

Ragnar: Little man.
Hvitserk: Father!
Ragnar: Hello, son. Oh, I've missed you.
Thank the gods!
Ragnar: You still have it. Ubbe: Yes.
Aslaug: I knew you were coming back.
I saw you down in the field three days ago.
(Baby coos)
What did you call him?
His name is Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye.
I warned you, my love.
You questioned my prophecy, but here's proof of it.
In your child's eye is the serpent my father killed.
It is not a curse, it is a blessing.
<U+266A>
I was afraid that I would never see them again.
I always knew you would find us.
(Gasp of pleasure)
(Sigh)
No, we cannot have s*x. Not for three days.
Ragnar: No more prophecies.
Just want to feel the warmth of it, the heat of it.
(Footsteps approach)
Siggy: Rollo is back.
Rollo: Hello, brother.
Welcome to this shithole we call home.
Ragnar: Shall we talk?
(Latch rattles)
Ragnar: I want to attack Kattegat. Now!
I want to destroy Jarl Borg, I want to make him suffer as he has made my family suffer.
I want to kill that Madr Strodinn with my bare hands.
Then I must be frank with you, brother.
I know you lost boats in the storm, but it's a pity you didn't return with more men.
As it is, we have no chance of defeating Jarl Borg, or regaining Kattegat.
Then we find more men. There are no more to find!
Believe me, I've tried.
And what's more... Is that news of your arrival has only made our discovery more certain.
Jarl Borg has placed a fortune on your head.
(Angry sigh)
(People chatter, goats bleat) Woman: The sheepskins are over in the shed over there.
(Hooves thunder)
Woman: Can you help here? Can you help me lift this up?
(People chatter, goats bleat)
Jarl Borg: I am happy that Ragnar Lothbrok has returned.
It will be a pleasure to fight him.
Surely the gods will reward handsomely anyone strong enough to defeat him.
After all, they have never taken kindly on those who seek to join them, pretending in their vanity to be gods themselves.
Ragnar Lothbrok is one such, and his vanity will kill him.
No, not his vanity.
I will kill him!
Men: (Boisterous cheering) Yeah!
(Distant metallic clanking)

You are being crucified in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Athelstan: (Shuddering in pain) In manus tuas...

(Hooves thud)
Athelstan: Please... please...
Ecbert: Wait!
Man: It's the king! Man and woman: Your majesty!
(Shuddering in pain)
Crowd: Your highness. Sire. Your highness.
Must we really kill this man?
Bishop Edmund: He is an apostate.
He has denied our Savior Jesus Christ and returned to pagan and evil ways.
He has murdered good christians.
I say he should die.
I say he should be crucified. What do you all say?
Crowd: Crucify him! Crucify him! Kill him!
Cut him down.
(Shuddering in pain)
Ecbert: I said, cut him down!
(Gasping in pain)

Floki: Ragnar, they're here!

It has been a long time.
Hello, Ragnar.
I heard of your troubles.
I have brought these warriors to help you.
Ragnar: And you are?
Bjorn: I'm your s...
(emotional) Father!
I always knew in my heart that I would see you again.
But I never guessed it would be in such circumstances.
Bjorn: Who can guess the plans and ways of the gods?
But now they have contrived to bring us back together and I for one am glad for it.
Ha!
I do not need to ask if you have been fed well.
You have grown so tall.
When this is over, we shall have many stories to tell.
You and I, father, are bound both by ties of memory and blood.
It seems your mother and I have produced a son that is both strong and wise.
And if my sister had lived, she would have been the same.
Yes. And you are right to carry her memory, as do I.
For a long time, father, I feel I have carried nothing else but memories.
But now, here, in this place, with you, and with my mother, I feel... reborn.
As if I have a life to lead.
(Affectionate slaps)
Ragnar: Far too long.

Why do you not go home?
By staying you've given me time to raise a large army.
Thorvard: Your lands are lost, invaded by Jarl Borg.
Your family has fled only the gods know where.
I must find my family.
If I can be of help to king Horik Then I'm happy to stay.
Then so be it.
Your friends will be leaving at first light.

Lagertha, you're the last person I expected to see here.
You and your warriors are as welcome to us As spring after the hardest and most bitter winter.
Rollo, my son and I are only too glad To come to Ragnar's aid.
(laughs)
Freya and all the gods, Bjorn, You're a big b*st*rd now.
Thank you, Uncle.
Still can't grow a beard, though.
(emotional exhale)
Everything is new now.
Torstein: Good to see you, Bjorn.
Yes... Yes. (giggles)
You stayed true to your path.
Siggy!
Floki: You see him, Helga? He's all grown up!
Bjorn: I missed you so much.
Floki: You look stronger than your father.
Come, what have they been feeding you?!
You look like you've been eating a cow a day.
Bjorn: You are the one to talk.
Aslaug: I am grateful to see you.
Lagertha: Thank you, princess Aslaug.
(sigurd coos softly)
Bjorn: Princess.
My sons: Ubbe and Hvitserk.
I am pleased to see you.
I always knew that, some day, I would meet some more of Ragnar's sons.
Ubbe: How did you know?
And you have a baby? May I?
Aslaug: His name is Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye.
After your father?
And after his own father.
(low hum of chatter, goats bleat)
Ragnar: Enough with the pleasantries, let's make a plan.
Lagertha: So?
Torstein: Even with your additional forces, Lagertha, We cannot attack Kattegat and hope to succeed.
Jarl Borg is well dug in.
Lagertha: What do you propose?
Rollo: We want to drive Jarl Borg out of Kattegat.
He has no idea we have been reinforced.
Torstein: And what would make him leave Kattegat Where he can winter in safety?
Rollo: The one thing that would threaten His whole existence there.
Floki: And what would that be?
Food.
A few of us will go into the town And destroy the winter grain stores.
Floki: I will do it! I will go.
Ragnar: No. My son and I shall go.
We'll only need a few men.
(loud buzz of chatter, carts rattle)
Woman: Don't think we will be long now.
Man: Seems to me the case is quite clear.
Encompass everything else we've discussed... Yes, yes.
(door groans and shuts heavily)
King Ecbert: Thank you.
I cannot see your face.
Young woman: I am ex-wife of Christ: A nun.
I cannot show my face to any man.
Well, I am not \"any man.\"
I am King Ecbert And you will show me your face Or I will be unable to judge Whether or not you're telling me the truth.
(crowd murmurs)
Who did this to you?
My husband.
He claimed I had been unfaithful.
And were you... Unfaithful?
(whispering) No.
Hmm... What do pagans say of such cases?
(crutch taps lightly)
Athelstan: If she was a free woman, They would believe her word, And make judgment on her behalf.
King Ecbert: But surely her husband has every right over her?
Surely she belongs to him, to do with as he sees fit.
Not according to the pagans.
Then pagan laws are superior to ours?
Not in every case, sire.
Woman, I find it unlawful and disagreeable That your husband should make false claims against you.
He has provided no evidence of your cupidity.
Therefore, I dismiss his demand to have you branded in public.
Thank you. Oh, thank you, lord.
Oh, well, don't thank me.
Thank this pagan.

Man 1: Here, will you try some?
Man 2: They're all the same.
(townsfolk chatter)
My lord Aethelwulf.
I heard the pagans captured you when they raided Lindisfarne.
Is that where you're from, Northumbria?
Athelstan: Yes.
My father is making plans to visit The king of Northumbria.
Perhaps we will take you with us.
What for? Father Cuthbert is dead, The monks are gone, the monastery is burned.
What is left for me there?
Aethelwulf: Perhaps you've lost interest in your heavenly father?
Is it true you're a pagan now?
We are Christians here.
My father served at the court of the emperor charlemagne, The most devout of men.
If I were you, I would not forget to attend high mass...
That is, if you value your soul.
(bell tolls)
Baker: Bread! No stone in this bread! Best bread you can buy! Bread!

Mary, mother of Jesus.
I just wanted to thank you.

Ragnar: I love two women.
Both of them have given me children.
Seer: And you suppose you must choose between them?
Ragnar: No. I don't want to choose.
I would like to have both of them.
Seer: (chuckles) I see.
You know, of course, the story of the marriage Between Njord and Skadi?
Skadi was a giantess. Her father was killed.
She strode to Askard to get justice And the gods asked her if she wanted gold For the death of her father.
\"I'll settle for a husband,\" she said, \"and a bellyful of laughter.\"
Ragnar: This is going to be a long story.
Seer: If you are hundreds of years old, Then it's a very quick story.
Ragnar: Hmm.
Seer: The gods conferred and agreed That Skadi could choose a husband from among them, But they made one condition: That she chose him by his feet.
His feet?
Seer: Yes. And Skadi lost no time in choosing The most shapely pair of feet, Believing they would naturally belong to Balder, The most handsome of the gods.
Ragnar: But they didn't?
Seer: No. They belonged to the God Njord, The lord of seafarers and sea harvests.
His skin was old and weathered.
Ragnar: What are you talking about?
I don't want to make a choice between them, But if I did, Are you saying that I should decide Based on the appearance of their feet?
Seer: Neither their feet nor their faces.
You should examine their hearts, their livers, And every other organ.
In any case, it makes no difference.
You are only fooling yourself, Ragnar Lothbrok, If you think the choice is yours to make.

Bjorn: Agh! You have to pull!

Ragnar: Mmm...
They are all my children.
Bjorn: What are you boys doing?
(loud thunderclap, Ragnar sighs, amused)
Bjorn: There! You have it!
I am going to bear you another son.
I know.
Bjorn: What are you doing, huh?
But I am fearful of the prophecy.
Hvitserk: Caught you there!
(thunder rumbles)
What are you going to do about Lagertha?
What do you mean what am I going to do?
Bjorn: Stronger than this!
(boys laugh)
It is her decision.
I've never had a choice whether she comes or goes.
I will not tell her to go away, If she does not want to.
Then, if you like, I shall go away!
Oh, stop!
No doubt you prefer her because she is a Shield-Maiden.
A warrior.
In that way, she is more like you.
Bjorn: What are you going to do?
Bjorn and hvitserk: (laughing)
I don't want either of you to leave.
I want you both to stay.
I want to believe you love me.
Then believe me! Hmm?

(door creaks shut)
(sighs heavily)
I was wondering... - You were wondering what I was going to do.
Yes. Regarding my son.
I don't know what to do.
Then he should stay.
You both should stay.
Your wife would not be happy.
I imagine not.
(rain patters loudly)
Siggy: I think Ragnar is still in love with Lagertha.
Are you?
In a way, yes.
And yet, it seems to be another Rollo Who still loves her.
I am like a snake which has shed its skin.
The pattern is just the same, but the snake is new.
And this new Rollo does not love Lagertha, Or suffer from desires for her.
(loud thunderclap, thunder rumbles)
Does that answer your question?
Athelstan: (shallow breaths)
Please, lord, hear my prayer.
I am weak. Make me strong.
Come into me again, lord. Ravish me.
Open my eyes, lord, to the truth.
To your presence.
Why don't you show yourself to me?
Let me be filled again, lord, by the holy spirit.

I think his accusers just assume that we shall find him guilty And confiscate his land.
Men: Yes! Yes!
But, on this occasion, I believe he should keep his land...
(murmurs of concern)
And the accusers should give him...
Three sheep?
(crowd laughs)
All in favor, say baaaaah.
Crowd: Baaaaaaah. (banging)
Man: Ragnar!
Ragnar: Quiet! Thorvard.
Thorvard: My lord Ragnar.
I hope you bring better news than the last.
My lord, after you left, The Saxons treacherously attacked King Horik's camp at Wessex.
There was a terrible slaughter. A great many warriors perished.
The king and his son only just escaped with their lives.
What about Athelstan? What happened to Athelstan?
My lord, I don't know of whom you speak.
Why has it taken so long for me to hear this news?
My lord, bad news travels a great deal slower Than good news.
(worried murmurs)
Man 1: Make way, make way.
Man 2: It's Lagertha.
Man 1: Make way, make way. It's Lagertha.
Ragnar: (whispers) We shall speak later.
Thank you.
What is wrong?
I have something important to say.
Should it be said in private?
No. I want to say it before everyone.
(townsfolk whisper)
Lagertha: I have come to a decision.
More than anything in the world, To stay here with his father.
And who can blame him?
If you had a father like Ragnar Lothbrok, Would you not want to stay?
(murmurs of agreement)
I happily give my permission to my beloved and only son To remain here with his father and his half brothers.
As for me... I must go back to my husband.
I have a duty; I am a responsible person.
(upset murmurs)
But I leave my son in your good hands.
(fire crackles, quiet murmurs)
Look after him, Ragnar. He's all I have left.
(townsfolk murmur quietly)
(loud chatter resumes)
(horse snorts)
Aslaug: Lagertha.
(sighs heavily)
Thank you.
There are no possible words to describe What you have done for us.
I will always be in your debt.
The debt is already paid.
The future is open. Trust in the gods.
Live for each moment.
(horse whinnies)
Don't take any more sh1t!
Lagertha: Who do you think I am?!

							Ragnar: Previously on \"Vikings\":
Thorvard: The Saxons treacherously attacked King Horik's camp.
The king and his son, Erlendur, escaped with their lives.
Ragnar: What about Athelstan?
Bishop Edmund: Here is your destiny, apostate!
Cut him down!
I know things about Ragnar Lothbrok you do not know.
How do I know you and I can trust each other?
It is always a strength to know the weaknesses of your friends.
Lagertha: Bjorn is very happy here.
Then you both should stay.
Lagertha: I must go back to my husband. I have a duty.
But I leave my son in your good hands.
Lagertha: Don't! Sigvard: I am your husband!
Ragnar: I want to destroy Jarl Borg and to kill him with my bare hands.
To make him suffer, as he's made my family suffer.

<U+266A> More, give me more <U+266A>

Seer: Tell me what it is you want.
Are you unhappy?
Do you think the gods have cheated you?
Siggy: I want my old position back.
I am bitter and I am angry.
Everything I had, everything I possessed, everything that I was has been stripped away from me.
And my anger is like a stone...
A stone that I carry inside me that... Weighs me down.
I... I cannot lift it.
Seer: In some ways, you are still fortunate.
Ragnar could have had you killed at the same time as your husband.
Siggy: I am supposed to be eternally grateful to my husband's killer?
I ask you once more, why you have come here.
I want to know, will the gods ever smile on me again?
Seer: The gods will always smile on brave women, like the Valkyries, those furies who men fear and desire.
(Bird cries)
(Birds cry)
(Oars stroke the water)
(Water churns)
(Chatter and laughter fill the hall)
Man: Erik!
You'll have to forgive the poverty of the feast.
It has been a hard winter.
We had to burn our own grain stores to rid ourselves of Jarl Borg.
Horik: So I heard.
Ragnar: Tell us, Erlendur, what happened in England, after we left?
King Horik: Ecbert never meant to honor his promises to you.
We were betrayed, taken by surprise; it was a great slaughter.
Erlendur and I barely escaped with our lives.
What about Athelstan? Where is he now?
If he is fortunate, he died in battle.
In any case, let's not speak of him.
He was a worthless individual.
Bjorn: Poor Athelstan.
My sister and I grew to love him when we were children.
Floki: He fooled you, young Bjorn.
He never denounced his Christian God!
He was our enemy.
We should rejoice at his death.
So... What do you intend on doing now?
King Horik: What do you think, Ragnar?
I intend on gaining revenge on King Ecbert.
We should plan a raid as soon as possible.
Rollo: I would be very happy to take part in it.
King Ecbert should certainly be punished.
I agree.
We should return to Wessex.
But first, Jarl Borg must pay the price for what he did to my family and to our people.
(Water pours)
Porunn: (Gasps)
Forgive me, master.
No, it doesn't matter.
King Horik: I understand, completely, and if I were you, I would feel the same way.
But we must remember our agreement and what it was for.
We would sail west to raid and to colonize.
That was your dream, Ragnar, and I have come to share it.
But now we have neither the men nor the ships to realize our dreams.
What are you saying?
I think we should go back to Jarl Borg.
He is licking his wounds.
He is no longer as strong as he was.
And, yet, we need him.
We cannot go west without his ships.
And so, once again, we should ask him to join our alliance.
Aslaug: (Whispers quietly)
Don't listen to him.
Rollo: But who should go to Jarl Borg?
King Horik: I think it should be you Rollo.
After all, you know him better than anyone.
What do you think?
(Wind howls)
Farewell, my love.
I will pray to Thor that he grant you safe passage.
Warrior 1: Throw that!
King Horik: May you have success, Rollo, for the sake of all of us.
Warrior 1: Man your stations. Warrior 2: Stores aboard.
Warrior 1: All the men aboard!
Torstein: Rollo.
Warrior 2: Try the sail then.
I, too, wish you well.
Those words mean a lot coming from you.
They were hard to say. Now they are said.
Cast away!
Warrior 1: Ready the oars!
(Oars stroke the water, water churns)
(Wind howls fiercely)
(Wine pouring)
(Fire crackles)
Horik: It has an unusual taste, wine.
But then, you're an unusual woman, Siggy.
I hope you do not mind I brought my son with me?
I want him to start to understand the game.
The game?
The game you and I play.
The game Ragnar tries to play.
Are you sure it is a game?
Why do you invite me to your bed?
Why do you tell me things about Ragnar?
Everything I do, I do for Rollo.
And not for yourself?
If Rollo rises, I rise also.
And you need my help!
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles) My son is ignorant of the game and strangely ignorant of other things as well.
He's only been with a few women, and they were nothing... Slaves, girls.
I want him to enjoy the attentions of an experienced, free woman.
(Exhales, taken aback)
(Retreating footsteps)
(Clothes rustle)
Siggy: Erlendur, come.
(Approaching footsteps)
(Fire crackling)
(Swallows and grunts)

(Passionate moans)
Sigvard: (Drunkenly) She sees a hall more fair than the sun, thatched with gold, at Gimle.
There shall the gods in innocence dwell, and live forever a life of bliss.
(Loud belch, ale pours)
Why don't we have poets here anymore?
Poets to entertain us!
Sing to us!
Make us laugh.
I remember when this great hall was always full of laughter.
Laughter and good fellowship.
Woman: You can see it in her eyes.
My wife has returned to me.
(Scoffs) That's good.
Men: (Chuckling)
She went without my permission.
But, as you can all see, she has come back and I love her for it.
After all, what man wouldn't be pleased at the return of such a wife?
Skol!
Crowd: Skol!
Lagertha: Skol, husband.
Unfortunately, you left my stepson behind.
Man: It's time to leave.
(Women quietly withdraw)
Woman: Gerta, take my hand. Come. Come.
He's old enough to decide.
Is it not enough that I came back?
No, it's not enough, my dear wife, it's... It's not enough!
Of course it's not enough. It's an insult to me!
What else could I have done?
His father is Ragnar Lothbrok.
(Sudden thud, cup clatters)
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?!
Nothing but a windbag, an opportunist.
A man so bloated with self-importance he pretends to be descended from Odin!
(Men laugh)
He doesn't need to pretend anything.
(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)
Now I know for sure why you went to defend him.
Not to repulse a foreign invader, as you lied to me, but because you're still in love with him.
You're still in love with Ragnar Lothbrok, aren't you, wife?
(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)
You can sleep alone tonight.
I have made other arrangements.
(Howling in the distance, owl hoots)
(Floor creaking)
(Approaching footsteps)
(Fearful gasp and exhale)
(Blows out candle)
(Door bangs open)
(Fighting grunts, punching blows)
(Pained grunts, fighting grunts)
Lagertha: Ungh!
(Pained grunts)
(Repeated blows, grunts of effort)
Master, can I help you?
I was going to ask you the same question.
Those buckets look very heavy.
I'm used to it.
Bjorn: What is your name?
Porunn: Porunn.
Sit a moment.
I have to finish my work.
It is all right.
Man: Please don't insult my ancestors.
(Chickens clucking, pigs oinking)
(Metallic clanking, chickens clucking)
(Metallic clanking, sheep bleating)
Where do you sleep?
In that barn with the other servants and animals.
Do you... Have a boyfriend?
Of course!
(Sheep bleats)
I must finish my work.
(Chickens cluck, sheep bleat)
Woman: Sven! Sven!
Aslaug: She is remarkably good looking.
Ragnar: If you say so.
Hor decide everything?
Can you really forgive Jarl Borg?
Do you know how much I suffered because of him?
How much your sons suffered?
Yes, I know.
But you do nothing about it!
By insulting and humiliating me, he insulted and humiliated you!
My father never would have allowed such a thing.
He would have been revenged.
Your father cannot do too much now, being dead.
(Foliage rustles underfoot)
(water flows nearby)
(Slow, calming breath)
Jarl Borg: Sit down.
(Approaching footsteps)
What is that?
Jarl Borg: The skull of my first wife.
She continues to advise me.
Is that fair to her?
So... Your brother wants me to come and fight for him?
He wants to rebuild the original alliance between himself, King Horik, and you.
He believes that, in our small countries, cooperation is the only way forward.
So he does not want revenge upon me?
After all, I invaded his lands.
Men like you and I will always look for revenge.
Ragnar looks beyond.
Then he is a most extraordinary man indeed.
As forgiving as a Christian!
He is also a practical man.
He and King Horik have lost a lot of men.
They need you to help them raid.
Jarl Borg: What do you say, my love?
(Inhales deeply and kisses skull)
You think I should go?
She thinks I should go.
(Birds chirp)
(Bell tolls)
You have a great gift, Athelstan.
I believe it is a... A divine gift.
Athelstan: Thank you, sire.
I thought I might have forgotten, but...
I love these materials.
Brushes, the paints, the colors.
I had not appreciated how much I missed my work.
The pagans have nothing like it?
Athelstan: No. They have no art.
They can neither read nor write, except for their carved runes.
King Ecbert: Mm.
And their gods?
Uh... Odin and Thor and Freyr.
How strange you must have found them?
Their gods are very old.
And sometimes I could not help noticing some similarities with our own God, and his son.
Come with me.
King Ecbert: Tell me honestly: What do you think of these works?
Athelstan: I find them indescribably beautiful.
King Ecbert: But they are clearly pagan!
(Laughs)
You are only a monk, Athelstan, and yet, somehow, I begin to trust you.
I feel you... You are a kindred spirit.
Who? Who painted these images?
What race of man was ever so glorious that they filled our world with such, as you say, indescribable beauty?
I have been told, sire, that you served at the court of the emperor Charlemagne, which I have also visited.
I cannot imagine, therefore, that you do not know what I know.
That these images were painted by the Romans.
They conquered these lands a long time ago.
They conquered the whole world.
But they were pagans. They worshipped false gods.
Never speak of our conversation to any other man here.
Nobody else would understand it; they would fear it!
They accept an interpretation that a race of giants once lived here...
(Chuckles)
And that we have nothing to do with them.
(Both chuckle)
The fact is, Athelstan, we have lost more knowledge than we ever had!
These romans knew things that we will never know.
Their pagan gods allowed them to rule the world.
And what is the lesson that we can learn from that?

Aethelwulf: Monk, my father desires to see you.
(Birds chirp)
(Door creaks open)
King Ecbert: Come and see.
Look around.
You thought those paintings were all that there was.
But of all Roman things, these are the most precious.
Tales of the Caesar's.
The fall and ruin of Roman Britain.
Tales of emperors and empires...
It's the stuff of dreams, Athelstan.
It's the very fabric of dreams.
You can read them, of course.
(Dust scatters)
Athelstan: Yes. Yes, I can read them.
King Ecbert: Good. That is why I've chosen you.
Athelstan: What do you mean?
King Ecbert: Well, I've chosen you to be the guardian of these books and their secrets.
I want you to copy them.
You speak Latin; Not many do.
Your job will be to preserve these works and these... Fragments for all eternity.
But if you ever tell anyone about them, I will let them crucify you.

(Loud buzz of chatter fills the hall)
Man: Jarl Borg.
(Loud chatter)
Ragnar: Please.
Jarl Borg: Earl Ragnar Lothbrok, can I say, in all honesty, a greater man than I am.
I know I don't deserve the chance you have given me to raid and work with you, but I swear on my ring, from henceforth, you've no reason to doubt my loyalty, or my commitment to our common cause.
If we are being honest, I can tell you that it was King Horik who argued for a renewal of our alliance.
As you can imagine, I was not, at first, enthusiastic.
But then... Then I realized what could be gained by inviting you.
We have much to gain if we work together, and a lot to lose if we don't.
Even I can see that now.
(Chuckles softly)
(Chuckles, pleased)
Torstein.
Yes, my lord.
Ragnar: Put Jarl Borg's men in the barn which the servants use.
And treat them with respect.
Of course, my lord.
Thank you.
King Horik: (Chuckles) Siggy.
I never once for a moment imagined Ragnar would take my advice, and invite Jarl Borg to rejoin our alliance.
As I told you, Ragnar is different.
Whatever you think he will do, he will always do the opposite.
And I wanted to thank you for what you did for my son.
You made him a man.
Do not ask me to do it for your other sons.
I am not a whore.
Oh, no. Just for me!
(Loud chatter fills the hall)
Can you keep a secret?
(Giggles) No.
(Howling)
(Music and chatter fill the hall)
What's the matter with you, my love?
You don't talk, you don't smile.
(Gasps in pain)
(Kiss)
My love, you must do better than this.
You know something?
My wife has got the most beautiful breasts.
I keep telling her, but she doesn't believe me.
She has the most beautiful breasts in the world.
(Music stops, chatter quiets down)
They're like Freya's breasts.
The breasts of a goddess.

Aslaug: The giant king's servants carried a trencher into the hall and set it down before the throne.
They heaped it with hunks of chopped meat, and it reminded Thor that rather too long had gone by since they had last eaten.
Ubbe: Thor was so hungry!
A chair was provided for Loki at one end of the trencher, and for Logi at the other.
(Footsteps scuff)
(Eagle cries)
(Footsteps scuff)
(Ominous music)
Aslaug: At the word from the giant king, they both began to eat.
They gobbled and consumed and devoured.
Ubbe and Hvitserk: (Giggle)
Each of them ate as fast as they could, edging their chair forward, and they met at the middle of the trencher.
Loki had eaten every scrap of meat and left nothing but the bones.
(Fire crackles)
(Blade rings, Rollo breathes angrily)
Siggy: Where are you going?
(Door slams shut)
(Fire crackles)
But Logi had not only eaten the meat, he had eaten the bones, and the trencher as well.
Ubbe: I think Logi won.
(Gasps awake)
(Long, slow exhale)
(Distant echo of bones rattling)
Who is it?
Seer: Yes, I can see, and I see an eagle.
I see that an eagle hovers over you.
But I also see that you yourself are the eagle.
(Shuddering breath)
(Echo of bones rattling)
(Wings beating)
Aslaug: (Whispering) \"I would say,\"
proclaimed the giant king, \"that Loki is the loser.\"
Hush, Ubba. Hvitserk is nearly asleep.
Now you go to sleep.
Ubbe: (Whispering) I don't want to.
(Whispering) Why not?
(Whispering) Because whenever you dream, you never know what is going to happen!
(Running footsteps)
(Lock clunks shut)
Men: (Groggy waking murmurs)
What's happening?
(Men protesting, banging) Hey! What?
If you want to live, stay silent.
Nothing will happen to you.

(Straw catches fire)
Men: (Alarmed shouting) No! No! Fire!
Young man: (Shouting) Let us out! Let us out!
Torstein: Where have you been?
Floki: Here and there. Up and down.
Rollo: Where is Bjorn? He is supposed to be with you.
Floki: I don't know, Rollo.
Rollo: Let's go.
(Approaching footsteps)
Bjorn: (Sniffs)
It is fine, come.
You can sleep here.
No, I can't.
Of course you can. Why not?
This is your place. I cannot sleep here.
Well, don't you want to?
What does it matter what I want to do?
Well, what if I ordered you to stay here?
Then I would have to... Heed your command.
I don't want to order you.
I want you to choose to stay here.

So what will you do now?

Jarl Borg must pay the price for what he did to my family.

At the same time, without Jarl Borg's ships and warriors, we cannot hope to mount a successful raid on Wessex.
(Wet, squishy sounds as rat is gutted)
We will find another ally.
(Hard whack)
When?
Soon.
I have sent out word.
Are you suggesting that my brother should reprieve Jarl Borg as if nothing has happened?
No. I am merely asking you stay your hand until another ally is found.
The execution of Jarl Borg made public would surely discourage and deter any possible partners.

Fine. I shall wait.

Yes.
Yes.

No, not Ragnar.
But, but he...
No.
I said, not Ragnar.
Everything here is for Ragnar.
I've known him a long time.

They could not find you.
Where were you?
I was with Porunn.
So it was your decision.
You chose to be with her, rather than me.
I only ask to be kept in your confidence as your son.
I will be the judge of how far I take you into my confidence.

Why would he stop at assassinating me?
He's Ragnar Lothbrok.
His fame eclipses even yours.
Let us say I believe you.
What would you have me do?
I would arrange for my escape.
And then I would kill Ragnar Lothbrok and make his brother Earl.
That's what I would do if I were you.
(Retreating footsteps)
(Rat squeaks)
I've brought you something.
(Shackles clank)
(Snake hisses)
RAGNAR: I've had dreams of the Priest Athelstan.
He comes to me, but I do not know where he is... in Valhalla or in Hell?
SEER: He is in neither place.
RAGNAR: Then he is alive?
(Blowing dust)
SEER: He is physically alive, but his spirit is tormented.
He does not know himself. I see that.
RAGNAR: You must tell me where he is.
(Wind gusts, parchment rustles)
SEER: He is with a man you know.
(Raven croaks)
A foreigner. A king.
(Snake hisses, Seer exhales)
(Wings beat)
(Fighting grunt, weapons clank)
(Men cheering)
ROLLO: (Speaking Old Norse)
(Fighting grunts, Rollo speaks Old Norse)
(Men cheer, laugh, and applaud)
(Lively chatter fills the hall)
(Rollo exhales heavily, trying to catch his breath)
What are you going to do about Jarl Borg?
You know exactly what I'm going to do.
Then why haven't you done it? What're you waiting for?
I told the king that I would wait.
I don't understand, brother.
Why do you keep making concessions to Horik?
Because he is the king.
(Chatter and laughter)
Why won't you talk to me?
There is not much to say.
We have everything to say to each other.
You can tell me about your whole life.
And I can tell you about mine.
There is not much to say about my life.
I've always been a servant.
Wait.
I thought you might be thirsty.
Thank you, Princess Aslaug.
You are kind.
I feel sorry for you.
It is all the same with we women.
We just give birth to the slaughtered.
BJORN: Rollo said that she is just a slave and I can have her any time.
Your uncle is heavy-handed when he speaks to others about the heart.
But, the truth is, he feels the pangs as deeply as you.
But warriors don't show their heart, until the axe reveals it!
You are so wise, Floki.
FLOKI: (Chuckles)
I'm not wise at all. I'm just a joker.
(Kiss)
Helga.
Siggy.
You are with child.
Yes.
Floki must be happy.
He's not happy? Why is he not happy?
It's complicated. Floki is complicated.
Will you marry?
Yes. Yes, we will.
With Earl Ragnar's blessing?
My love does not think that he needs Earl Ragnar's blessing.
Only that of the gods.
(Hall buzzes with chatter and laughter)
I have some interesting news.
Floki is angry with Ragnar.
HORIK: Floki? Floki loves Ragnar.
SIGGY: Hmm.
Ragnar Lothbrok is no longer alone in attacking our shores.
Mm. Yet for me... he is still the greatest disturbance to our world.
I agree, and very likely to return here.
AELLE: Mm.
ECBERT: We must be prepared for him.
If you and I and our kingdoms are allied together, we will be stronger.
If his army lands in Northumbria, I will come at once to your aid, and trust that you will do the same for me.
(Fire crackles)
(Chair scrapes, thuds on the floor)
Leave it.
All of you, leave.
(Retreating footsteps)
Mhh.
Mercia is a neighbor of mine, as it is of yours, so you know very well what is happening there.
Since the death of King Offa, the kingdom has fallen into turmoil, with several members of his family competing for the throne.
Offa's son and heir has been murdered by his own sister, and it seems there is no end to the violence and the chaos there.
It suits neither of us to have such an unstable and tumultuous neighbor.
But... if you and I joined together, not only against the Northmen, but also against Mercia, we should surely overcome it.
AELLE: Mm.
We could then divide Mercia up between us, as we saw fit.
What do you say?
I say, after we have conquered Mercia, what is to stop you from turning on your smaller ally?
(Sighs, considering)
At the moment, King Aelle, very little.
That is why I am proposing the formal marriage of my oldest son and heir, Aethelwulf, to your beautiful daughter, Judith.
Now then, what do you say?
Now I say... let us drink to our alliance...
(Goblets clink)
And may the devil never cast it asunder, hm?
(Chuckles)
(Slurps)
(Distrustful chuckles)
FLOKI: (Grunts with effort)
Hey, papa!
(Sword scrapes)
(Stream babbles, birds chirp and caw)
(Priests sing in Latin)
MEN: Yay! All right!
(Guests laugh and cheer)
(Water splashes)
FLOKI AND HELGA: (Giggle happily)
(Guests cheer, Floki giggles excitedly)
(Laughter)
(Cheers, laughter, and applause)

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
BISHOP: Do you, Aethelwulf, son of Ecbert, before all these witnesses here gathered, take this woman, Judith, daughter of Aelle, as your lawful wife, to have and to hold, from this moment until death parts you?
I do.
PRIESTESS: Helga...
You must hold this sword in trust for your son, and now you must present this new sword to the groom.
The sword transfers the father's power of protection over the woman, to her new husband.
(Laughter)
BISHOP: Do you, Judith, before all these witnesses, take this man, Aethelwulf, to have and to hold, and forsaking all others, to serve and obey, from this time henceforth, until you die?
I do.
PRIESTESS: Now the rings.
Floki, do you swear to the gods that you want to marry this woman?
I swear, with the gods as my witnesses.
Helga, do you swear to the gods that you want to marry this man?
I do swear.
BISHOP: Let these rings be a permanent sign that you are united in holy matrimony, in the eyes of these people, and in the eyes of God.
ALL: Amen.
PRIESTESS: Then you are married.
(Floki giggles, everyone cheers)
(Laughter and cheers erupt)
(Rain patters heavily)
(Hooves thud)
Rollo Lothbrok?
Yes.
I have come to talk to your brother... upon important business.
And what business would that be?
Believe me, your brother would want to hear me.
(Throwing grunt, hard whack)
RAGNAR: Ooh!
(Laughs drunkenly)
You son of a whore.
One more.
TORSTEIN: Wait. My turn.
(Spits then grunts)
RAGNAR: All right.
(Preparatory exhale)
Torstein?
Here! I'm here.
Is your shield up? It is so dark in here!
(Loud thwack)
Ha!
RAGNAR AND TORSTEIN: (Laugh drunkenly)
This is my brother.
RAGNAR AND TORSTEIN: (Laugh)
RAGNAR: And you are?
You sent word that you needed a new ally to attack Wessex.
The word reached us and we are happy to say that we can provide such an ally.
RAGNAR: (Scoffs)
An Earl with enough ships and men to make your raid a great success.
His name is Earl Ingstad.
Earl Ingstad?
Earl Ingstad.
(Arrow strikes shield, torstein pants)
Never heard of him.
TORSTEIN: (Laughs drunkenly)
Why is he not with you?
He did not want to waste the journey.
He wanted to be certain that you were still in need of an ally.
When can I meet him?
You can meet him at any time.
Yes!
He is ready to attend.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
TORSTEIN: (Laughs drunkenly)
(Doors shut)
(Wind howls fiercely)
We have found a new ally.
Earl Ingstad... Whoever he is.
When will he arrive?
A few days.
And then Jarl Borg will be executed.
That cannot come too quickly for my liking.
(Clothes rustle)
(Door creaks open)
(Rats squeak)
(Door bangs shut)
(Passionate gasps and moans)
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!
Why do you do it?
Why do you sleep with King Horik?
(Sharp inhale, exhales slowly)
I do it for you.
(Choked gasp)
Please!
(Exhales sharply, gasping for breath)
What can King Horik do for me that my brother cannot do?
Right now they are allies... long may they remain so... but in the event that they should fall out, you should be able to choose between them.
Horik is a king.
Never forget that.
Never doubt how much power he has.
What have you decided?
I have decided to take your advice.
I will set you free.
There are those here who will help me.
People who only pretend to be loyal to Ragnar.
(Shackles clank)
And then?
And then we will kill Ragnar Lothbrok.
BJORN: I want to ask you something.
What is a Blood Eagle?
The offender gets down on his knees... and his back is opened with knives.
And then, with axes, his ribs are chopped away from his spine.
And then his lungs are pulled out of these huge, bleeding wounds and laid upon his shoulders, so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle.
And must he stay like that, suffering, until he dies.
(Bathwater churns)
If he suffers in silence, he may enter Valhalla.
But if he screams, he can never enter its portals.
(Quick, loud knocking, door creaks open)
Earl Ingstad is here.
(Bathwater sloshes)
Where is he?
He would not enter the great hall.
He chose instead to remain in the woods.
(Door closes)
(Horses gallop, whinnying)
(Horse whinnies, hooves thud softly)
(Horse snorts, hooves thud softly)
Earl Ingstad?
(Sighs)
Earl Ingstad!
You bear a strong resemblance to my ex-wife.
If I had given you my true name, you might have turned me away.
How is Bjorn?
He is happy.
He is looking forward to going to England.
As am I.
So you are truly an Earl?
Yes. We are equal.
I'm sure this is difficult for you.
It is not difficult at all.
How many ships?
Four ships.
Over a hundred warriors.
So will you accept me as an ally?
RAGNAR: (Clears throat)
That depends.
On what?
I have been betrayed by earls before.
So if you are really Earl Ingstad, then it's a no.
But if you are still the Lagertha I remember, then it is a yes.
(Horse snorts)
RAGNAR: Earl Ingstad.
LAGERTHA: (Laughs)
(Rat squeaks, door opens)
(Shackles clank, hay rustles)
(Door creaks closed)
(Frightened gasp, shackles clank)
(Shackles clank)
BJORN: (Frightened gasp)
(Eating greedily)
(Shackles clank)
(Awkward swallowing grunts)
(Swords clank, fighting grunts)
LAGERTHA: More power!
Faster!
(Landing blows)
(Attack yell, swords clank)
LAGERTHA: Ungh!
SHIELD-MAIDEN: Aghhhh!
SHIELD-MAIDEN 2: You say you try.
That was not expected.
No. It wasn't.
What do you think of it?
I think the gods are playing a joke on me.
(Laughs)
It is not a joke.
I know.
What do you think?
I like her.
My former wife?
Hmm...
I would rather be her.
Ah!
She is formidable.
LAGERTHA: Be stronger!
The gods are having a good time with me today.
ASLAUG AND RAGNAR: (Laugh)
SHIELD-MAIDEN: Attack!
(Swords clank, fighting grunts)
It will be dark soon.
(Hissing)
(Door creaks open)

							Ragnar: Previously on \"Vikings\":
Without Jarl Borg's ships and warriors we cannot hope to mount a successful raid on Wessex.
We will find another ally.
I want my revenge on King Ecbert and I shall have it.
Envoy: You need a new ally to attack Wessex.
We can provide such an ally.
His name is Earl Ingstad.
Lagertha: Over a hundred warriors.
Will you accept me as an ally?
King Ecbert: Ragnar Lothbrok is no longer alone in attacking our shores.
If you and I join together, we should surely overcome him.
Rollo: Why do you keep making concessions to Horik?
Ragnar: Because he is the king.
Floki: Everything here is for Ragnar, but he cannot have everything.
Siggy: Floki is angry with Ragnar.
Aslaug: I told Ragnar if he forced himself on me in the first three days of his return, I would bear him a monster.
(water drips, muted chanting)
Sorceress: (Chanting in old norse)
Aslaug: (Cries out, weeping in agony)
Sorceress: (Chanting in old norse)
Aslaug: (Grunting and weeping in agony)
(Cries out in agony)
(Grunts and wails in agony)
Siggy: (Concerned exhale)
Princess Aslaug, listen to me.
You are in an open field.
On one side of you is a deep pit filled with bones and ashes and hellish things.
On the other side is your house, your sons, the Fjord, and the sunlight is striking the snow high on the mountains.
If you want to reach your house, then you must push the baby out as Freya would.
Let him rip you, but push... Out.
(Shaky breaths)
Choose life.
(Distorted chanting)
Siggy: Yes.
Aslaug: (Cries out in pain)
Siggy: Yes.
Sorceress: The baby will come.
Aslaug: (Grunts in pain)
Siggy: That's it! Good.
Sorceress: I see the head.
Aslaug: Agggghhhhhhhhhhhh!
(Panting, relieved)
(Crying)
(Baby cries)
Siggy: It's alive.
It is alive.
Sorceress: It's a boy.
(Baby coos)
King Horik: We must prepare to go to Wessex.
Obviously, we must leave soon.
Lagertha: I have to return to my territories.
I have to prepare my ships.
It will take some time.
King Horik: How much time?
Bjorn: Just enough time.
No more, no less, King Horik.
Porunn: Your father has a new child.
Bjorn: A son?
Porunn: Yes.
King Horik: I must congratulate your father.
It is never a bad day to have a son.
The gods cannot stop offering him their blessings.
Erlendur: I, too, am happy for Earl Ragnar.
King Horik: Erlendur.
Lagertha: Who are you?
Porunn: Porunn.
Lagertha: I meant, who are you to my son?
Bjorn: She is a servant. A slave...
(Waves lap at the shore)
And I am in love with her.
(Preparatory breaths)
(Baby fusses)
(Bites umbilical cord and spits)
(Sighs)
(Sighs heavily)
(Sniffs and sighs dejectedly, baby coos)
Ragnar: After all, your prophecy was right.
(Baby fusses)
(Footsteps thud loudly, rain patters)
King Horik: Don't be too long.
Lagertha: I won't.
King Horik: I need you.
If the three of us are equals, we need each other.
But one cannot be more equal than the other.
You mean Ragnar.
You and I are at least his equal, and Ragnar must come to understand this.
I agree.
Siggy: Lagertha!
To keep you warm.
What is wrong with Ragnar's new son?
Siggy: Nothing. Be safe.
Lagertha: How loyal you are, Siggy.
(Rain patters loudly)
Agh! (Vicious thud)
(Shields strike hard, weapons clank)
Don't die stupidly.
I'm not going to die.
(Sword strikes)
Agh!
Rollo: Yes, you are! If I choose.
Agghhh! (Axe strikes)
Rollo: Fight!
(Water splashes, swords clash)
(Blade slashes) Ugh!

(Axe strike rings, surprised gasp)
(Distorted axe strike, distorted shout of surprise)
(Blade rings, water splashes)
(Sword strikes sand)

(Grunts)
Always remember to finish off your opponent, if you can.
No man ever ran away with his entrails hanging to his knees, or his head cut off.
(Blade rings)
Rollo: Your mother is an amazing woman.
Bjorn: I know.
You were in love with her once.
(Thunder rumbles)
Well, believe me, those feelings are wasted.
Don't the gods love?
Who is to say their love is wasted?
(Chuckles)
How come you know so much about the gods?
Because my father, you and I...
Are all descended from Odin.
Or is that not true, uncle?
He will die anyway.
What is the point of pretending?
If we were wolves, or even pigs, this poor, weak runt would be discarded.
(Baby coos)
(Sniffles)
We are not wolves or pigs.
Ragnar: It is natural.
We let such babies die for their own good.
For what kind of a life could he live?
I know, but I don't care.
(Fire crackles)
(Loud buzz of chatter)
(Sheep bleat)
Aethelwulf: Always so behind the times!
Athelstan: Well, that's true. My work is for all eternity.
Athelstan: Who is coming?
Aethelwulf: Kwenthrith.
The daughter of Offa!
Athelstan: King of Mercia?
Aethelwulf: Well, before he died, that is.
Athelstan: Not his son?
Aethelwulf: Don't you know anything?
Kwenthrith killed her brother, Offa's natural heir.
Now the whole kingdom is beset by dynastic squabble.
Everyone is murdering everyone.
Athelstan: Presumably...
King Ecbert doesn't want to get involved with such terrible squabbles?
Aethelwulf: Of course not.
My father has no interest whatsoever in what happens in our neighboring kingdom, which just so happens to be the largest, most important, and richest kingdom in England.
Athelstan: So this is our fratricide.
Our mass murderer.
King Ecbert: Welcome, princess, to the Kingdom of Wessex.

Women: Lagertha! Lagertha!
Man: My lady.
Woman: It is good to see you!
Einar: Welcome back, Earl Ingstad. We've all missed your presence.
Lagertha: Thank you, Einar.
But you will have to do without my presence a great deal longer.
It is agreed that I am to raid the English kingdom of Wessex with king Horik and Earl Ragnar.
(Shouts of excitement, bells jingle)
I expect my ships to be provisioned by the next full moon, and all my warriors to be armed and assembled.
Man and woman: (Chatter excitedly)
(Doors burst open, royal trumpet bellows)
(Cheering and applause)
(Music plays, lively chatter fills hall)
Kwenthrith: Oh, no meat for me.
I don't like it. It kills you.
(Bishop laughs)
Kwenthrith: Only vegetables.
Who are you?
My name is Athelstan. I was a monk at Lindisfarne.
A monk!
King Ecbert: Athelstan was captured by the northmen.
He's lived amongst them.
He knows everything about their pagan ways.
I have heard that the pagans sacrifice human beings!
Is that true? Do they actually?
Every nine years, yes, they do.
To please their gods.
Kwenthrith: And are they naked?
I have been told that they make love to whomever they choose, and that the idea of fidelity is utterly strange to them.
They have... A different morality to us.
Is it not more natural?
Athelstan: I...
Kwenthrith: (Distantly)
Is it not more natural?
(Moans of pleasure) Is it not more natural?
(Heavy breathing)
(Echoing) Is it not more natural?
Athelstan: I... I would only say that it is different.
(Loud buzz of chatter)
(Light clang)
Kwenthrith: How boring you are!
King Ecbert: I was shocked to hear of the death of your brother.
Kwenthrith: Oh, don't worry about my brother.
Did you know that the Pope has already made him a Saint?
Saint Kenelm!
Apparently, he lived an exemplary life!
King Ecbert: Do you mean to say that he was not altogether virtuous?
Kwenthrith: Well, he raped me when I was about twelve.
Bishop Edmund: (Coughs violently)
Kwenthrith: So you must make up your own mind.
King Ecbert, I do not need to ask why you've invited me here.
I know very well.
You want to influence the destiny of Mercia.
My family are killing one another, and you want to be on the side of the party which succeeds to the crown.
You put it very precisely, princess.
It should not surprise you to hear that myself and my allies will succeed.
But, perhaps, your support would be an advantage.
King Ecbert: I was thinking of sending my son, Aethelwulf, to advise and help you.
I would gladly open my gates... To your handsome son.
Aethelwulf: (Chuckles)
King Ecbert: I would also like to hire some northmen as mercenaries to help you succeed in gaining the throne of Mercia.
Kwenthrith: I need to meet these northmen whose prowess, in all things, I have heard so much about.
Heh.
It seems no one can talk of anything else now.
King Ecbert: So let us drink...
(Chairs scrape back)
To princess Kwenthrith, and the conquest of Mercia.
All: The conquest of Mercia!
(Cups clink)
(Low, muffled roar, water ripples lightly)
(Water splashes, Lagertha sighs)
(Bathwater splashes, Lagertha sighs repeatedly)
(Chimes jingle lightly)
(Animal howls in the distance)
(Chuckles softly)
Lagertha: Einar, why don't you come in?
(Slurps)
(Door creaks open, bathwater sloshes)
Do you want to speak to me?
Einar: Yes.
Lagertha: Then wait.
(Water splashes)
Einar: (Breathing heavily)
What do you want to say?
(Exhales heavily)
(Liquid pours)
Einar: I thought we had an agreement.
I don't remember any agreements, Einar.
You do remember!
I would help you become Earl, and then, as a result, we might be married.
Lagertha: I never made any arrangements.
Not with you, nor with anyone else.
You wanted rid of Sigvard because he was insane.
So I killed him.
That's all.
Einar: (Breathing heavily, unsheathes dagger)
If you do not let me enjoy you, I shall open your face!
Lagertha: And then... What would your family do, hmm?
If they had any respect for you, they would have made you Earl, not me.
The truth is, you couldn't kill me.
The only person you could kill was a dying man.
That's how brave you are.

King Ecbert: Athelstan is a... He's a spiritual man.
Kwenthrith: (Gasps, turned on)
Well, I've never met a spiritual man who doesn't like to make love like an animal.
Don't... Don't... Don't you want to sleep?
Are you insane?
Where are you going?

Ragnar: Thank you.
Torstein: What is the matter with you?
Something the seer told me.
What did the seer tell you?
That Athelstan is alive.
Athelstan? But I thought he was dead.
That's what King Horik led me to believe.
He also said that Athelstan betrayed him.
King Horik: How is Ragnar treating you these days?
He treats me well enough.
It is my judgment that a boat builder...
Is worth ten earls.
And how many kings?
(Chuckles)
If you decide to build boats for me, I would certainly treat you like a king.
You think you can buy me with riches?
I would never insult you like that.
What I need from you, Floki, are your ideas...
For they are worth more than gold and silver, and they come from the gods.
Are you sure they do?
Ah, yes... Yes, I'm sure.

King Ecbert: Your friends have returned.
Athelstan: My friends?
King Ecbert: A large fleet of northmen have come ashore in Wessex.
One of the ships, I am told, was flying the black raven banner of Ragnar Lothbrok.
What will you do?
I hope I can negotiate with Ragnar.
When we met before, he struck me as different.
Intelligent.
He will listen to reason.
Good.
But if not, I will fight him.
I have already sent a message to King Aelle, asking him to supply warriors, according to our treaty.
Whatever happens, I will not be defeated.

Shield-maiden 1: It's secure.

Shield-maiden: The fires going out. Inge, help me!

Shield-maiden: Cover this here!
Warrior: And dig a trench for it.
Shield-maiden: Tie it with this rope.
I never imagined the west would be so wet!
King Horik: Where is Torstein going?
I sent him to inform the king of our return.
Why?
Ragnar: So he knows that we are here to talk...
And not to fight.
And you did that without consulting with me.
Ragnar: I thought you would both agree.
King Horik: Why should you think that?
Ragnar: Because it is a sensible policy.
Fine, I will...
Unfortunately, it is too late to recall Torstein.
Lagertha: You should have discussed it with us; King Horik is right.
Ragnar: I will try to remember that the next time, Earl Ingstad.
King Horik: There is not going to be a next time, Ragnar, unless you agree you will never ever do anything again without consulting with me first.
For you and I are not equals.
So, what do you propose now?
Ragnar: Wait.
Lagertha: For what?
Ragnar: The unexpected.
King Horik: Let me tell you what to expect, hmm?
King Ecbert will send some envoy to trick us, or he will send some army to annihilate us.

Ragnar Lothbrok, my father, King Ecbert, sends his greetings.
He hopes that you will be prepared to talk to him.
Ragnar: I am prepared.
But we would have to exchange hostages.
Aethelwulf: Of course.
And my father also sends you this, as a token of his good will.
Ragnar: This is Athelstan's.
I gave it to him.
Then he is alive.
Aethelwulf: Athelstan is waiting to see you at my father's villa.
You have his guarantee of safe passage, as well as my father's.
Ragnar: Then...
We will all come to your father's villa.

What will you do?

King Horik: But you will never ever do anything again without consulting with me first, for you and I are not equals.

King Ecbert: Princess Kwenthrith of Mercia!
I would like to hire some Northmen as mercenaries to help you succeed in gaining the Throne of Mercia.
Aethelwulf: Athelstan is waiting to see you at my father's villa.
He hopes that you will be prepared to talk to him.
King Ecbert: Ragnar Lothbrok is no longer alone in attacking our shores.
If you and I join together, we should surely overcome him!

Athelstan: Caesar had sent his cavalry a little in advance and was following with the rest of his forces.
The battlefront was not formed according to rules of military theory, but as necessitated by the emergency and the sloping ground of the Hillside.
The legions were facing different ways and fighting different actions.
The 9th and 10th legions were on the left, and discharged a Volley of Spears at the Atrebates.\"
King Ecbert: Yes. He's always thinking, always using the terrain.
Go on.
Athelstan: At the same time, the Roman cavalry and light-armed troops, seeming to appear from nowhere
King Ecbert: Ahah! But he knew where. They were in here.
And what of his person! What of he himself?
Athelstan: As the situation was critical, Caesar moved to the front of the line, addressed each centurion by name, and shouted encouragement to...\"
The fragment ends here.
King Ecbert: Hmm. But we can imagine how it really ends.
We must do battle with Ragnar Lothbrok and his allies.
I cannot believe that Ragnar does not want to negotiate.
I know him too well. He's looking for land, farming land, for his people.
King Ecbert: His men killed all of my envoys, sparing only my son.
By which they sent me a simple but clear message.
Athelstan: Why not send me to speak to him?
You are already too dear to me, and too important.
Which is why, I think, they would kill you.
Athelstan: When? When will you attack?
King Ecbert: As soon as King Aelle returns with his warriors.
I'm sure you would prefer that Earl Ragnar and I made peace.
Perhaps then you could be at peace with yourself.
Ragnar: King Horik, your behaviour has made it very difficult to talk peace or to negotiate with King Ecbert.
King Horik: I never had any intention of negotiating with King Ecbert.
I thought you were aware of that.
I only want revenge.
I want to kill King Ecbert.
And then, perhaps, I shall talk to him.
Lagertha: If we defeat Ecbert in battle, he may be prepared to offer us more in terms not only of gold, but of land.
Ragnar: This was a gift in good faith.
King Horik: What is good faith?
Why should there be good faith between us and Christians?
What do you say, Floki?
Floki: They worship a false God.
They're fleas and vermin.
Ragnar: I will go myself and talk to him.
King Horik: You will not divide our forces, Earl Ragnar.
You seem to forget I am King.
We will strike camp tomorrow, and, armed and ready, we will go to seek battle, as our father Odin has taught us.
Erlendur.

Bjorn: I can't sleep.
I am thinking about what it is like to die.
Only those who have died would know.
The Seer would know.
Ragnar: He is not truly dead. That is his curse.
He told me something about you.
That you would marry the daughter of a King, or else sail round a sea that has no tides.
Then I shall not die tomorrow?
Not according to the Seer.
(Fire crackles)
Bjorn reminds me of Odin's favourite son, Balder.
You know the story.
Floki: The Gods made everyone swear an oath that he would be safe.
Nothing could injure Odin's favourite son.
King Horik: The Gods even tested the oaths.
They threw stones at him, darts, struck him with axes, and slashed at him with swords, but it seems nothing could harm Balder.
Floki: Everyone rejoiced that it was impossible to hurt Balder.
All except Loki.
The sly one watched with distaste and impatience.
And it sickened him to see how Balder was immune from all sorts of attacks.
Yes. The sly one knew he had to find a way to kill him.
Athelstan: Help me, Lord.
Who are these Gods who haunt my nights and wreck my peace?
Odin, Thor, Freyr...
You have taught us not to worship false Gods, but I have seen them.
I have seen Thor in the sky!
I have seen the Sparks from his anvil.
I felt the sea heave with his anger.
(Sighs)
Why is this false?
Things that I've seen with my own eyes.
Things that Ragnar believes.
Whatever happens, do not let Ragnar die...
Nor yet Lord Ecbert.

King Ecbert: Athelstan, who is it?
Do you know this man?
King Aelle: I know this man.
His name is Rollo. He's Ragnar Lothbrok's brother.
We baptized him, but it made no difference.
King Ecbert: It is unfortunate that he's dead.
Rollo: (Gasps in pain)
Athelstan: No! He's still alive!
King Ecbert: Father!
This is an important man.
See what you can do to save him.

It had nothing to do with you or I.
Bjorn: Agh!
(Shield crashes)
(Hard kick)
(Tired exhale)
Ragnar: You fought well today.
I was fortunate, that is all.
Ragnar: You were favoured by the Gods.
Favoured?! We were defeated.
We live to fight another day.
We lived, but my Uncle died.
We do not know if he is dead.
It would take a lot to kill him.
Since no axe, spear, or blade could touch my son today, he will be known as Bjorn Ironside.
Lagertha: We must make some decisions, and we must make them quickly.
Do we leave tomorrow and abandon this raid?
Bjorn: If my Uncle is captured and wounded, I want to stay in this place...
As long as it takes until he is free.
Ragnar: (Sniffs) Well, King, what are we fated to do?
(Rain pours down)
King Aelle: Victory over the Northmen!
(Loud cheering and laughter)
King Aelle: Now your father surprised them with his tactics, hmm?
He surprised me too!
How do you know these things?
Who knows, sire?
Maybe he read something somewhere, which helped him.
Reading, for monks mostly!
Very little use otherwise.

Athelstan: Rollo!

(Goblet splashes)
Allies and friends, huh?
Mmmmuah!
(King Aelle and men laugh)
When shall we attack again our wounded foe, huh?
And wipe them out?
(Men laughing)
King Ecbert: That might not be a good idea.
King Aelle: Of course good idea! We've won half a victory.
Now, with God's help, we'll annihilate our enemies, hmm?
King Ecbert: Forgive me, King Aelle, but I might suggest that even the complete destruction one Northern army will not lead to the end of their incursions.
Probably quite the opposite.
Motivated by greed and by the need for revenge, they're very likely to return with renewed strength.
And not just once or twice, but again and again, times without number.
The only way to bring an end to these incursions is to negotiate an agreement that is good for both sides.
But, in the meantime, King Aelle, buying the services of these Northmen, as mercenaries, will certainly help us to overcome Mercia.
Aelle: Mm. Very well. As you say.
But someone has to take this offer to the Pagans.
That is, if they have not yet already sailed away.
(Spurting)
Indeed.
Bishop Edmund: Considering their treatment of our envoys so far, you're not going to have too many volunteers.
(Men laugh)
Aethelwulf: I have a suggestion.
I think we should send Athelstan.
King Ecbert: But they may kill him.
Aethelwulf: (Laughs) Oh, I doubt that.
In any case, would it matter?
King Aelle: (Laughs)

Athelstan: I wish it was so simple.
In the gentle fall of rain from heaven, I hear my God, but in the thunder I still hear Thor.
That is my agony.

Who then?

Me?!
King Ecbert: Well, except for myself, there is no one that the Northmen will place a higher value on than you and they are bound to know the consequences if they should harm you in any way.
Of course, if you do not wish to place yourself at risk...
No, no. I will play the part.

Now you've had your say.
All this for your brother.
We're all put in danger for your brother.
Why must we save your brother?
He killed Arne, he nearly killed me.
He betrayed all of us.

He is completely sincere in his wish for peace and cooperation and believes that Ragnar Lothbrok shares his wish.
The King will agree to pay you monies and/or treasures to prevent any further depredations of his territories.
More importantly, he is prepared to offer
5000 acres of good land, for farming, in peace.
Finnaly, may I present you Princess Kwenthrith from the kingdom of Mercia.
King Ecbert and the Princess are willing to pay any of your warriors a fat fee for fighting for her.

King Horik: Floki, we can be honest with each other, can we not, hm?
We know each other well enough.
We know the things we like and those we hate.
We share many things...
Many ideas, feelings, about the Earth and the Gods.
Am I not right?
Yes.
I have a proposition to put to you.

KING HORIK: Earl Ragnar, you seem to forget I am king.
JARL BORG: Ragnar Lothbrok wants to be king.
His fame eclipses even yours.
SIGGY: I'm supposed to be eternally grateful to my husband's killer.
Everything that I was has been stripped away from me.
I want my old position back.
I helped Ragnar rise and now he is earl.
Earl Ragnar.
And our little world waits upon him and eats from his hand.
King Horik understands the gods better than Ragnar.
There is something about him.
RAGNAR: You talk about trust. You!
FLOKI: I am a trustworthy person.
KING HORIK: We know the things we like and those we hate.
I have a proposition to put to you.
<U+266A> More, give me more <U+266A>
<U+266A> Give me more <U+266A>
<U+266A> If I had a heart I could love you <U+266A>

I must help your father.

MAN: Erik, come here. We have some work to be done.
MAN 2: What is it?
HELGA: Floki.
Floki, it's me.
(Geese honk nearby)
FLOKI: Helga!
HELGA: (Softly) Hey...
(Baby coos)
(Hammering nearby, low hum of chatter)
(Geese honk)
We have a child, Helga.
Yes, we have a child.
HELGA: A beautiful girl.
FLOKI: A girl!
You did not come, so I brought her to see you.
A girl!
I don't want to drop her.
You won't drop her.
(Baby coos quietly, geese honk nearby)
A girl...
A beautiful, beautiful girl.
How is it possible?
(Baby fusses)
Take her back.
Take her back.
(Baby fusses)
HELGA: What shall we call her, (softly, to baby) hey?
FLOKI: Angrboda.
The name of Loki's first wife?
Yes, yes.
But she's...
What's wrong with that?
They thought she was evil. They had monstrous offspring.
She was a great giantess, Helga!
Will you come back with us?
Will you get to know your daughter?
No. I have to stay in Kattegat.
But you, you must go home.
Can't I stay awhile...
You don't understand, Helga! You have to leave!
Leave! Leave!

ERLENDUR: (Playful growl)
Welcome! Welcome to Kattegat!
KING HORIK: (Loving growl)
ERLENDUR: Sisters.
KING HORIK: (Kiss) Darlings!
(Light kiss)
Are you well?
GUNNHILD: Yes, all of us are well now.
KING HORIK: Come! Come, family! I want you to meet Ragnar. Huh?
ERLENDUR: Are you hungry?
(Townsfolk cheer, axes and shields pound)
(Cheering)
(Cheering and applause fills the hall)
MAN: Welcome!
KING HORIK: Ragnar Lothbrok, my friend and ally, and all your family gathered, let me properly present to you my wife, Gunnhild, and my children.
(Cheering and applause)
KING HORIK: Ragnar, you and I have formed an alliance on which the future of our country and its people depends.
In this endeavor, I see you more than ever as an equal.
(Murmurs of agreement)
Between us... and, of course Earl Ingstad... we have already accomplished so much.
We have land and opportunity in Wessex...
(Cheers erupt)
But that is only the beginning.
We know already there are many other worlds to discover, and we shall do so together, united even more by the bonds of family... for you have many sons and, as you can see, I have many daughters.
(Laughter erupts)
It is our custom to celebrate such an alliance as the gods celebrated theirs... with feasting and with pledges.
TOWNSFOLK: (Cheers erupt)
TORSTEIN: Yeah!
(Hall buzzes with chatter and music)
GUNNHILD: You must be the famous shield-maiden Lagertha.
LAGERTHA: Oh, you are more famous, Gunnhild.
The poets talk of your exploits.
They tell how you killed Swein Forkbeard when he invaded Gotaland.
GUNNHILD: And they say that you are now an earl in your own right!
How did it happen?
LAGERTHA: I killed my husband when he invaded me.
GUNNHILD AND LAGERTHA: (Laugh)
(Hall buzzes with chatter and laughter)
KING HORIK: What is it?
FLOKI: Don't you remember?
I heard you were going to put a proposition for me?
KING HORIK: Was I?
FLOKI: Yes! And I am still waiting!
HORIK: The thing is, Floki, I'm not entirely sure I can trust you.
WOMAN: Over here! I have something for you!
MAN: Bring it with you!
(Angry grunt)
(Celebratory cheers, bells jingle)
BJORN: Porunn, you are a free woman now.
What will you do with your freedom?
I will use it to choose.
BJORN: To choose what?
PORUNN: You don't understand.
When I was a slave, I loved you.
You were the first to treat me as if I was not a slave.
But now, I have choices.
There are plenty of other women here.
That is your first mistake.
(Low hum of chatter, retreating footsteps)
(Wild cheers fill the hall, music plays)
CROWD: Hey! Hey! (Laughter)
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)
FLOKI: Ah, Torstein...
Up to your usual tricks I see.
TORSTEIN: These two beautiful women approached me.
They chose you for the size of your silver pouch and nothing else.
TORSTEIN: I don't think about it too much.
If these women don't love me, (scoffs) what do I care?
They will still make me happy.
WOMAN: Here! Have some more!
WOMEN: (Laugh)
(Cheering and laughter)
KING HORIK: Siggy.
SIGGY: I am pleased to see you.
I would like to know your plans while you are here.
KING HORIK: My wife is here, and my children are here.
That's all you need to know.
MAN: You again! You again!
(Music plays, people converse and laugh)
(Celebratory shouts and laughter)
Why did you come back, priest?
Nobody wants you here.
You betrayed the gods!
You betrayed all of us.
It's your fault Rollo's going to die.
(Nauseous grunts)
(Ale pours into cup)
KING HORIK: Forgive me, Floki.
I know I should trust you, but I need proof.
FLOKI: Proof?
KING HORIK: Yes.
Prove to me I can trust you.
Prove to me you are on my side.
How can I prove it?
Kill someone. Someone who matters.

BJORN: Next summer, I say we should return to Wessex, claim our land from King Ecbert.
Those who wish to farm should do so, and divide the land between them.
KING HORIK: What should the rest of us do, hmm?
Those who do not wish to be farmers.
BJORN: Those can join King Ecbert and Princess Kwenthrith in the battle for Mercia.
I am sure they will be rewarded well.
KING HORIK: I agree with you.
I think we should claim the land, but I do not like the idea of being Ecbert's handmaiden.
I still have a score to settle with him and unlike Ragnar, I do not trust him.
ERLENDUR: But isn't it best to test him to see if he is honest?
ATHELSTAN: I believe he is telling the truth.
LAGERTHA: Then you are still innocent.
KING HORIK: So you agree with me?
LAGERTHA: No. I agree that those who wish to farm should do so and also ask for King Ecbert's protection.
But for some of us, those of us who still want to raid, we will go elsewhere, explore and discover new places.
(Door creaks open, goat bleats outside)
(Door creaks closed, footsteps approach)
SIGGY: (Relieved sigh)
(Goats bleat outside)
FLOKI: How is he?
SIGGY: He's alive.
Will he ever walk again?
Only the gods know.
(Fire crackles nearby)
(Laboured breath)
Do you watch over him day and night?
Listen. I'll stay with him for a while.
FLOKI: You get some sleep.
SIGGY: No, I...
Go get some sleep, Siggy.
You deserve it. I will watch him.
Thank you.
ROLLO: (Laboured breath)
You put me in a bed like this once, Rollo.
Do you remember?
(Dog barks in the distance)

I brought you something.
Look!
It's the food of the gods.
Eat!

(Hall buzzes with chatter and laughter)
CHILDREN: (Playful laughter)
GIRL: Catch me again!
MAN: I'm warning you!
FLOKI: Ubbe!
Give this gift to Torstein.
Say that they are from his good friend Floki.
Oh! And one more thing.
You must never tell anyone that it was me who gave them to him.
That must be our secret. Do you agree?
Good. Because if you don't keep this secret, something terrible will happen to you.
Do you know what will happen?
I'll tell you.
When the God Loki had done something terribly bad, the other gods took him to a nasty dark cave.
And there they chained him on three sharp rocks, and above him they fastened a vile snake so that its poison would drip, drip, drip forever on Loki's face.
Now, you wouldn't want that to happen to you, would you?
Well, go and give my present to Torstein, but keep the secret.
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)
(Ominous music plays)
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)
BJORN: My friend Torstein has been murdered.
I swear by all the gods, whoever did this will pay a heavy price.
(Women weep)
FLOKI: We'll find the guilty one!
And we shall flay the skin from his body and use horses to tear him apart!
(Sobs)
(Torch fire crackles)
(Thunder rumbles, loud thunderclap)
KING HORIK: You did well.
(Floki unsheathes a knife)
Now I know I can trust you.
FLOKI: So, what is your plan?
I will kill them all.
FLOKI: All?
KING HORIK: Yes, all.
FLOKI: Ragnar?
KING HORIK: Of course Ragnar.
And Lagertha, and Aslaug.
All of them. All their b*st*rd children.
I will wipe his family from the face of the earth.
(Thunder booms and rumbles)
And Bjorn? What of Bjorn?
Bjorn Ironside. He is difficult to kill.
Perhaps the gods are protecting him.
You must find a way to kill him.
I have no doubt you will manage.
I know you will manage.
(Thunder booms and rumbles)
FLOKI: When?
(Thunder rumbles, rain pours down)
Tomorrow.
Be prepared, my friend.
(Rain pours down)
(Loud thunderclap, rain pours down)
(Rain pours down)
(Thunder booms and rumbles)

Forgive me for what I said.
I don't want other women. I want you.
What do you want from me?
PORUNN: Respect.
BJORN: You know I respect you. I worship you.
PORUNN: I don't want to be worshipped.
I spent my life as a slave. Your words are ridiculous.
BJORN: What can I do?
You can fight me.
Fight you?
Yes.

ROLLO: (Struggling gasps)

Oww!

It's no use!
Don't give up.
ROLLO: (Breathing heavily)
What do you care if I give up or not?
Do you want an honest answer?
I don't know.
But I think you might still be useful somehow.
To whom?
(Fire crackles)
(Axe clunks)
(Retreating footsteps)
(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)
Shouldn't you be with your wife?
Doesn't she have need of you?
KING HORIK: Don't play games.
SIGGY: There are no more games.
KING HORIK: Yes, there is, and this is the final one.
You once promised you would tell me Ragnar's weaknesses.
I don't ever remember you delivering on that promise.
SIGGY: Well, you wasted all your seed on a promise.
KING HORIK: Tell me now.
SIGGY: Is it not obvious?
Ragnar's weakness is his children.
Then this is what you must do.
You must go to the Great Hall at sunset and you must kill Ragnar's young sons.
What do I get in return?
I will marry you.
Gunnhild is my only wife at the moment.
I will take a second.
I will make you a queen.
You will rule again, as you once did.

FLOKI: (Unsheathes sword)

KING HORIK: This is the Sword of Kings.
One day, if the gods will it, this sword will belong to you.
Today we must do something extraordinary.
We must overcome the magic of Ragnar Lothbrok, which threatens our power and survival.
The gods have spoken, and I have listened.
We must cut and kill in such a frenzy none can survive.
For, believe me, if even one of that family survives, then the day will come when he will rise again and destroy us.
Put yourself in the hands of the gods, do their will.
And then, for certain, they will grant you this sword, and a kingdom.
(Trunk thumps shut)
Come.

Will you teach me one of your prayers, so I can learn?

Birds squawking:
Athelstan voiceover: I am not of this place.
And yet I have become one of its sons...
Walking among good men, great men, warriors, and kings.
And I, neither Christian nor pagan, perhaps both.
Bird squawking: But, in truth, can anyone faithfully serve two masters?
It is a question that plagues me, a question, I fear, that plagues us all.
I yearn to understand.
Pious reflection and contemplation were my life before... before Ragnar Lothbrok.
You are here because I spared your life.
Why did you spare my life?
I don't know yet.
Athelstan: For many moons now, the answers I seek have come from him, a man of vision, a man who would see beyond what is known.
Once a simple farmer, he, too, yearned to understand.
Ragnar: I believe there's a way to go west using this.
I've heard such tales, Rollo... great towns and cities and treasures.
Haraldson: We will raid east again, to the eastlands and into Russia.
Every year... we go to the same places.
Haraldson: They're my ships, and they go where I tell them to go.
Now that's the end of the matter.
Floki, what about our boat?
Floki: Will it be strong enough?
Ragnar: We won't know that until we try.
Athelstan voiceover: A great man is only as great as those around him.
Floki: God is striking his anvil!
He is celebrating!
He loves this boat!
Man: Get down, you idiot!
Floki!

Sit down!
Floki!
Man: Quickly!
Why was the warning bell rung?
They've come. They're here.
Man: Who is here?
Man: Hell and all its devils!
Men yelling:
Athelstan voiceover: So much blood, so much death.
It is their way.
Ragnar: It was easy to take all of these things.
Here is one of their priests.
But you understand that all this belongs to me.
Each one of you can take one thing from this hoard.
What will you choose?
I will take the priest.
Why does your god need silver and gold, hmm?
Christian people give away their riches to save their souls.
What are their souls?
Athelstan voiceover: And yet something about these ways, about him fascinated me.
I want to sail west again. Give us back our boat.
Very well. On one condition.
A warrior I trust goes with you. Knut?
Ragnar: You will not regret this.
Athelstan voiceover: As the blood they spilled roused them so brutal, so primitive, so, too, it roused me, and I was shamed.
Once I worshipped only the blood of Christ, but then I saw the blood of men spilled on Earth, and I became a servant to another master.

Athelstan voiceover: What is a man without honor?
Never before did I have reason to question my own honor until I came to this place.
Earthly temptations tested me daily.
Come and join us, priest.
Athelstan voiceover: The shield maiden, she is unlike anyone I had encountered.
Shield wall!
Athelstan voiceover: Warrior, wife, mother.
Kindness and ferocity are her trade in equal measure.
But above all is honor.
Get out. Leave her alone.
Athelstan voiceover: So it is for them all.
They would rather distinguish themselves and die...
Where is Knut?
Athelstan voiceover: Than live without honor.
Where is Knut?
I killed him.
Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok, I am happy to salute your achievements.
But I don't see my friend Knut.
Where... where is he?
I killed him.

He tried to rape my wife.

My brother.
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.

What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.
Haraldson: Does he desire to be earl?
If he kills you, will it not be so?
Athelstan voiceover: But for all their fidelity to the gods, their honor, their remedies can sometimes be so... human.
Let the man who thinks that he is descended from the gods learn that he is human after all.
Bjorn: Should we run?
No, we stay. Your father will be back.

Uh!
You have to go now. You have to get to the boat.

Athelstan: For everything, there is a season and a time for every matter under the sun.
Athelstan voiceover: At times, these remedies are too human.
And the pain of our earthly bonds are almost too much to bear.
He tortured my brother.
Athelstan voiceover: Never more so than for her, this woman, this fierce warrior who must, by virtue of her fairer s*x, yield to the honor of men when sometimes there is no honor at all, only violence.
I want you to go into Kattegat.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the earl.
And when you meet him, challenge him to a personal combat with me.

How will we ever be equal now? family...

You were once married to an earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Athelstan voiceover: A shared enemy...
Aethelwulf: It seems they intend to stay here a while as scavengers, little more than beasts.
We must be able to outthink them.

Yes.

Ragnar: Until the odds are in our favor.
man: We're being attacked.
Athelstan voiceover: And inspired leadership always wins the hearts of men.
Ragnar: Who are you?
Aethelwulf: I'm Lord Aethelwulf, brother of King Aelle.
Yet you lead his army.
Hmm.
Ragnar: Shall we go visit the king?
[Aelle claps hands]
What do you want for the safe return of my brother and for leaving my kingdom?
 2,000 in gold and silver.

How much?
 2,000.

Aelle: I agree to the terms.
But first I desire that either you or one of your companions agrees to be baptized into our faith.
That way, I can make peace with a friend and fellow Christian and not an enemy.

Athelstan voiceover: Most surprising of all is the loyalty born of kindness.
I want to serve you.
Lagertha: If it's really what you want, I accept your offer.

Carelessly tended, it is a torch to the fire of vengeance.

Athelstan voiceover: Who would not rejoice at being cleansed of his sins, renewed and made whole again?
It is a consolation devoutly to be wished.
Ragnar: Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us.
Athelstan voiceover: But what if there are some sins, some desires that cannot be purged, that are a part of us like some poisonous shadow?
Father, hear my prayer.
Accept this sacrifice I plan to offer you.
Then answer me: who will bear me my son?
Athelstan: What is this?
Ragnar: These will all be killed as sacrifices.
Athelstan: There's nine of everything.
Yes.

It's for the humans.

No.

For if you are not cleansed, do you not serve two masters?
Are you not drawn down the path of duplicity?
Siggy: Should you not be meeting with King Horik now?
That's where your brother is.
If you weren't so stubborn and so drunk, you would be there too, but you weren't invited.
There is a Jarl in Gotaland, Jarlg.
But he continues to claim he has legal rights over some of my land.
And how can... I be of help?
Travel to Gotaland as my emissary.
If the issue is settled, I shall be forever in your debt.
My name is Aslaug.
We're on our way to see the great ash tree.
Will you come along, Aslaug?
Athelstan voiceover: Duplicity and treachery dwell in the hearts of all men, and the gods punish us for these sins.
[screaming]
Athelstan voiceover: The gods forgive our sins, but do our brethren?
Are we ever truly forgiven by men?
I've betrayed my god, and I'm no man to judge.
But in my mind, to sin and betray a brother on Earth is as grave a treachery as to betray the father in heaven.
Well, what do you say?
I say yes.
I will fight with you against my brother.

You are leaving, then.

So it has been with Princess Aslaug, aided by the gift of extra sight.
Aslaug: I make this prophecy.
My father killed the dragon Fafnir, and our new son will be born with the image of the serpent in his eye.
This much, I know.
Athelstan voiceover: But there are some things not even the princess could foretell.
Siggy: I know things about Ragnar Lothbrok you do not know.

I might be interested in what you know, but how do I know you and I can trust each other?
Athelstan voiceover: I have spilled my share of blood.
Athelstan: Ragnar!
But should my own blood be spilled, would it flow Christian or pagan?
When my blood flows freely and stains this Earth, is it heaven or Valhalla that awaits?
I pray the gods know, for I do not.
But the blood in my veins is not what troubles me.
It is the blood of men that stains my hands and torments my soul.

Your lands are lost.
Your family is fled; only the gods know where.
Now Jarl Borg lives in your great hall and rules in your place.
You're leaving.
Of course I am.
I must find my family.
Ragnar: I want you to stay here.
If I can be of help to King Horik, then I am happy to stay.
Ragnar: I'm surprised to hear you say that, for you know my family better than anyone.
There he is.
Uh!
Ah!
Athelstan voiceover: If fortune favors you, you can run to your family.
I knew you were coming back.
What did you call him?
His name is Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye.
In your child's eyes, the serpent my father killed.
It is not a curse.
It is a blessing.
Athelstan voiceover: Or perhaps they will run to you.
And you are?

Athelstan voiceover: The savage... he lives in all of us, some more than others. But he is there, the devil to our better angels, brutal, lethal. It seems we are condemned to live between savagery and divinity, between the desires of this world and the demands of the next.
Cut him down. Cut him down.
I think we should go back to Jarl Borg. We need him. We cannot go west without his ships.
So he does not want revenge upon me?
Ragnar looks beyond.
I hope you were telling me the truth, Rollo.
What is wrong?
I must go back to my husband. But I leave my son in your good hands.
Don't take any more sh1t.
Who do you think I am?
Athelstan voiceover: And they do live for each and every moment on this earth. It is the pagan way. It is a way that enthralls and repulses me, a way that I love and fear.
You left my stepson behind.
My wife has got the most beautiful breasts. Let me show you.
(People gasp)
(Sigvard screaming)
(All gasp)
For savagery sometimes hides its face, only to leer from the shadows again, lustier than before.
Ragnar: Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
I will draw a blood eagle on your back.
No.
Yes.
(Speaking Latin)
Athelstan voiceover: I look for deliverance at every turn, for if I don't find deliverance, I fear what may become of my soul...
Because what is certain in the hearts of men is that savagery inevitably comes for you.
Bjorn: What is a blood eagle?
Ragnar: The offender gets down on his knees. And his back is opened. And then his ribs are chopped away from his spine. And then his lungs are pulled out of this huge bleeding wound and laid upon his shoulders so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle.
If he suffers in silence, he may enter Valhalla.

Agony and toil, ambition and triumph... we endure it all in the name of the gods.
But are we serving the gods, or are we only serving ourselves?
I choose to travel with King Horik.
He understands the gods better than Ragnar.
Athelstan voiceover: Is it our earthly appetites that rule us or our aspiration to the heavens?
Horik: What I need from you, Floki, are your ideas, for they are worth more than gold and silver, and they come from the gods.
Where is Torstein going?
I sent him to inform the king of our return.
You should have discussed it with us.
You will never, ever do anything again without consulting with me first, for you and I are not equals.
Athelstan voiceover: How are we mortals to know the divine when we barely know each other?
\"Caesar had sent his cavalry a little in advance and was following with the rest of his forces.\"
My yearning to understand exceeds my grasp.
We must do battle with Ragnar Lothbrok and his allies.
Horik: A large force but not large enough.
We will go down to them.
I think we should wait.

We have the advantage of the hill.

His name is Rollo.
He's Ragnar Lothbrok's brother.
(Breathing heavily)
Priest.
How could you?
You betrayed us.
Athelstan voiceover: I serve too many masters... great men and gods, warriors and martyrs, Christian, pagan.
Still I am torn.
Athelstan: King Ecbert desires me to set before you possible terms of a treaty.
He is prepared to offer 5,000 acres of good land.
Finally, may I present to you Princess Kwenthrith from the kingdom of Mercia.
King Ecbert and the princess are willing to pay any of your warriors a fat fee for fighting for her.
I accept the offer.
I am taking my brother home.
Floki: What is your plan?
I will kill them all.
Floki: What of Bjorn?
Horik: You must find a way to kill him.
Will you teach me one of your prayers?
Our father, who art in heaven...
Our father, who art in heaven...

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

Athelstan: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil forever and ever, amen.
Amen.
Floki, you have betrayed the gods.
No, King Horik.
I only betrayed you.
I was always true to the gods.
And Ragnar.

And I neither Christian nor pagan.

(CROW CAWS)
But in truth, can anyone faithfully serve two masters?
It is a question that plagues me.
A question, I fear, that plagues us all.
I yearn to understand.
Pious reflection and contemplation were my life before... before Ragnar Lothbrok.
You're here because I spared your life.
Why did you spare my life?
I don't know yet.
For many moons now, the answers I seek have come from him... a man of vision, a man who would see beyond what is known.
Once a simple farmer, he, too, yearned to understand.
Ragnar: I believe there's a way to go west using this.
I've heard such tales, Rollo.
Great towns and cities, and treasures.
Haraldson: We will raid east again, to the east lands and into Russia.
Every year... we go to the same places.
They're my ships and they go where I tell them to go.
Now, that's the end of the matter.
Floki. What about our boat?
Will it be strong enough?
Floki: We won't know that until we try.
A great man is only as great as those around him.
Floki: Thor is striking his anvil!
He is celebrating! He loves this boat!
Man: Sit down, you idiot!
Floki! Sit down!

Floki!

Quickly! This way!
Why was the warning bell rung?
They've come. They're here.
Who is here?
Athelstan: Hell! And all its devils!
Ha!
(SHOUTING)
(YELLING AND SCREAMING)
So much blood.
So much death.
It is their way.
It was easy to take all of these things.
Here is one of their priests.
But you understand that all this belongs to me?
Each one of you can take one thing from this hoard.
What will you choose?
I will take the priest.
Why does your god need silver and gold? Hmm?
Christian people... give away their riches to save their souls.
What are their souls?
And yet something about these ways, about him, fascinated me.
I want to sail west again.
Give us back our boat.
Very well. On one condition.
A warrior I trust goes with you.
Knut.
Ragnar: You will not regret this.
(ALL ROAR)
As the blood they spilled roused them, so brutal, so primitive, so, too, it roused me.
And I was shamed.
For once I worshipped only the blood of Christ, but then I saw the blood of men spilled on earth and I became a servant to another master.
Where do they come from, these pagans?
Some say from the north.
They are not welcome in my kingdom.
A master I didn't yet understand.
In the name of God, who are you?!
If you do not resist, we will not hurt you.
God bless.
No!
What is a man without honour?
Never before did I have reason to question my own honour, until I came to this place.
Earthly temptations tested me daily.
Come and join us... priest.
The shieldmaiden.
She is unlike anyone I had encountered.
Shield wall!
Warrior, wife, mother.
(SHRIEKS)
Kindness and ferocity are her trade in equal measure.
But above all is honour.
Knut! Leave her alone!
(KNUT GROANS)
(GROANS)
So it is for them all.
They would rather distinguish themselves and die...
Where is Knut?
...than live without honour.
Where... is Knut?
I killed him.
Ragnar Lothbrok. I am happy to salute your achievements.
But I don't see my friend... Knut. Where is he?
Ragnar: I killed him.
He tried to rape my wife.
Haraldson: Arrest him.
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother!
We have a witness to the killing.
What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.
Haraldson: Does he desire to be earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
But for all their fidelity to the gods, their honour, their remedies can sometimes be so... human.
Man: Back! Get back!
(WOMEN SCREAM)
Let the man who thinks that he is descended from the gods learn that he is human after all.
Bjorn: Should we run? No. We stay.
Your father will be back.
Take that!

You have to go now. You have to get to the boat.

Bring him back alive.
Yes, my lord.
There he is!
Bjorn: Father!
Athelstan: For everything, there is a season, and a time for every matter under the sun.
At times, these remedies are too human.
And the pain of our earthly bonds are almost too much to bear.
(BLADE SINKS)
He tortured my brother.
Never more so than for her, this woman, this fierce warrior, who must, by virtue of her fairer s*x, yield to the honour of men... when sometimes there is no honour at all... only violence.
I want you to go into Kattegat.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl.

Your lands are lost.
Your family has fled, only the gods know where.
Now Jarl Borg lives in your great hall and rules in your place.
You're leaving?
Of course I am. I must find my family.
I want you to stay here.
Athelstan: If I can be of help to King Horik, then I am happy to stay.
Ragnar: I am surprised to hear you say that.
For you know my family better than anyone.
(GROANS)
(MEN SHOUT)
(SCREAMS) (GRUNTS)
If fortune favours you, you can run to your family.
I knew you were coming back.
Ragnar: What did you call him?
His name is Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye.
In your child's eyes, the serpent my father killed.
It is not a curse.
It is a blessing.
Or perhaps they will run to you.
And you are?
I'm your s...
(RAGNAR SOBS)
The family I found in this place embraced me heartily and I revelled in that warm embrace.
And it may yet kill me.
(SCREAMS)
Athelstan: The savage... he lives in all of us... some more than others, but he is there, a devil to our better angels.
Brutal.
Gleeful.
It seems we are condemned to live between savagery and divinity.
Between the desires of this world and the demands of the next.
Cut him down. Cut him down!
I think we should go back to Jarl Borg.
We need him. We cannot go west without his ships.
So he does not want revenge upon me?
Ragnar looks beyond.
I hope you were telling me the truth, Rollo.
What is wrong?
I must go back to my husband.
But I leave my son in your good hands.
Don't take any more sh1t.
Who do you think I am?
And they do live for each and every moment on this earth.
It is the pagan way.
It is a way that enthrals and repulses me, a way that I love and fear.
You left my stepson behind.
(MEN GROAN)
My wife has got the most beautiful breasts.
Let me show you!
(ALL GASP)
(SIGVARD SCREAMS)
(ALL GASP)
For savagery sometimes hides its face, only to leer from the shadows again, lustier than before.
Ragnar: Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
(WHISPERS) I will draw a blood eagle on your back.
No.
Yes.
Creator, poscimus, ut solita clementia, sis praesul ad custodiam.
I look for deliverance at every turn.
For if I don't find deliverance, I fear what may become of my soul.
(CRUCIFIX CLATTERS)
Because what is certain in the hearts of men is that savagery inevitably comes for you.
Athelstan: What is a blood eagle?
Ragnar: The offender gets down on his knees... and his back is opened.
And then his ribs are chopped away from his spine.
And then his lungs pulled out of this huge, bleeding wound and laid upon his shoulders, so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle.
If he suffers in silence, he may enter Valhalla.
The expectations of the gods are a heavy burden to bear.
Agony and toil, ambition and triumph... we endure it all in the name of the gods.
But are we serving the gods, or are we only serving ourselves?
I choose to travel with King Horik.
He understands the gods better than Ragnar.
Is it our earthly appetites that rule us, or our aspiration to the heavens?
Horik: What I need from you, Floki, are your ideas, for they are worth more than gold and silver and they come from the gods.
Horik: Where is Torstein going?
I sent him to inform the King of our return.
You should have discussed it with us.
You will never, ever do anything again without consulting with me first.
For you and I are not equals.
How are we mortals to know the divine when we barely know each other?
\"Caesar had sent his cavalry a little in advance and was following with the rest of his forces.\"
My yearning to understand exceeds my grasp.
Ecbert: We must do battle with Ragnar Lothbrok and his allies.
Horik: A large force. But not large enough.
We will go down to them.
I think we should wait.
Horik: I'm not waiting! We have the advantage of the hill!
Man: Attack!
Ragnar.
Form!
Charge!
(ALL ROAR)
Shield wall!
Hold the wall!
Floki: King Horik!
Come!
I am besieged.
I am bereft.
I am at sea.
Do you know this man?
His name is Rollo.
He's Ragnar Lothbrok's brother.
Priest!
Look at you!
You betrayed us.
<U+266A> If I had a voice, I would sing <U+266A>
Athelstan: Who's coming?
Man: Kwenthrith, the daughter of Offa.
King of Mercia?
Well, before he died, that is.
Kwenthrith killed her brother, Offa's natural heir.
Now the whole kingdom is beset by dynastic squabble.
Ecbert: Let us drink to Princess Kwenthrith and the conquest of Mercia.
All: The conquest of Mercia.
Athelstan: I serve too many masters... great men and gods, Christian, pagan.
Still I am torn.
King Ecbert desires me to set before you possible terms of a treaty.
The King will agree to pay you moneys and/or treasures to prevent any further depredations of his territories.
More importantly, he is prepared to offer 5,000 acres of good land.
Finally, may I present to you Princess Kwenthrith from the Kingdom of Mercia.
King Ecbert and the princess are willing to pay any of your warriors a fat fee for fighting for her.
What about my brother?
The King will agree to release Rollo upon your acceptance of his offer.
I accept the offer.
I am taking my brother home.
This is the Sword of Kings.
One day, if the gods will it, this sword will belong to you.
Today, we must do something extraordinary.
We must overcome the magic of Ragnar Lothbrok, which threatens our power and survival.
Floki: What is your plan?
I will kill them all.
Floki: What of Bjorn?
Horik: You must find a way to kill him.
You must go to the great hall at sunset... and you must kill Ragnar's young sons.
Boys, come with me.
Ragnar: Will you teach me one of your prayers?
Our Father, Who art in heaven...
Ragnar: Our Father, Who art in heaven...
Athelstan: Hallowed be Thy name...
(YELPS)
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us...
Floki, where have you been?
Looking after you, Bjorn.
Like I promised your father.
Athelstan: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Forever and ever, amen.
Amen.
Floki, you have betrayed the gods.
No, King Horik, I only betrayed you.
I was always true to the gods.
And Ragnar.
(HORIK GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
Where is my light?
Who is my light?
Who will make sense of all that has come to pass?
I am lost.
The answers you seek cannot be found by looking to the past.
We must look to the future.
Stones and bones.
The Seer: The runes have been cast, but still you sit before me.
I do not mean offence, but...
But you do mean to question the will of the gods.
I mean to understand.
The gods?
To understand our predicament.
Torn between two masters, all of us.
This cannot be our fate... this discontent... this rage... this confusion.
You think you are confused?
The gods have not yet begun to toy with you, any of you!
(CROWS CAW)
Can any man ever be truly free?
There is freedom in death.
But not in this life?
The domain of man has many freedoms, all of them fleeting.
Then why go on at all?
To sow the seeds for the next world.
But what of this one?
We are wretched and bloody.
So many of the paths we tread end in butchery and death.
All that is certain is that whatever seeds are sown in this life will be harvested in the next.
What will be my harvest?
I have crossed the ocean so many times, fought with great warriors, read with wise men, but I am still no closer to the truth.
The Seer: The truth?
You cannot know the truth until you know yourself.
Who are you, priest?
I am a son of Christ and a pagan brother.
You are forked, like the serpent's tongue.
No. I am true.
You cannot be true to both.
You must make your choice.
(SOFTLY) No.
Oh, Lord!
Lord!
Praise the Lord!
I...I asked for a sign.
You have given me a sign.
You... you've answered my prayers.
I... I was blind, but now... now I see.
I was dead, but... I am reborn.
(COUGHS)
For so long, I have hungered for my place in this world, and the next, and now, by His abundant grace, I am saved.
But so too, I am not worthy of the love and kindness shown to me by these good pagan people.
No greater family on this earth could be wished for, no stronger embrace.
(CHANTS)
Perhaps even they are of His bounty.
For my struggles at their side have only brought me back to Him.
<U+266A> Amen <U+266A>
Floki.
Priest!
Lord, receive my soul.
And I am blessed, for His love... and theirs.
(ROARS)
The Seer: Two heads.
Two hearts.
Two faiths.
You came to me corrupt of both and slave to them.
You have cast off the burdens of this life, the burdens all priests must carry.
You have your truth.
And now... no matter your gods, the rewards of the next life... are yours.

I cannot fight you.
I have no choice but to leave you.
I accept you back, but I forbid you to raid with us.
Your lands are lost, invaded by Jarl Borg.
I always knew in my heart that I would see you again.
Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
Earl Ingstad.
You and I are not equals.
We must do battle with Ragnar Lothbrok and his allies.
Attack!
I want you all to know that Rollo is alive.
King Ecbert sends you!
He offers you a chance for peace.
King Ecbert is prepared to offer 5,000 acres of good land.
What about my brother?
The King will agree to release Rollo upon your acceptance of his offer.
I accept the offer.
As do I.
Will you come back with us?
You must kill Ragnar's young sons.
You have betrayed the gods.
[i](bones rattling)
What is it you wish to ask the gods?
Will I ever bear another child, o wise one?
I cannot see another child. No matter how far I look.
Then... what do you see?
(seer inhales deeply)
I see a harvest celebrated in blood.
I see a trickster whose weapon cleaves you.
I see a city made of marble.
And a burning, broiling ocean.
Not one of your prophecies do I understand.
It is the way of prophecy.
Only to be understood when it has happened, and it is too late to change it.
When will I die?
Frigg, the wife of Odin, has already made a decision.
But it has not yet been vouchsafed for me.
Come back another day, Earl and shield-maiden, and perhaps I may tell you exactly the moment of your death.
Bjorn: When the ice finally breaks, we will go back to Wessex and claim the land that King Ecbert promised us.
You know, that was always my dream.
(exclaims sharply)
I feel my blood warming!
I want to fight. I want to raid.
Why do you want to fight?
And what are you fighting for?
That.
(sighs)
What do you see?
Power.
The power of a king.
Power is always dangerous.
It attracts the worst.
And corrupts the best.
I never asked for power.
Power is only given to those who are prepared to lower themselves to pick it up.
<U+266A> More, give me more, give me more <U+266A>
<U+266A> If I had a heart, I could love you <U+266A>

(indistinct talking)
Lagertha: Einar.
Lagertha: Sit down, Kalf.
Will you come with me to Wessex?
No, Earl Ingstad.
Why not?
Don't you want to win renown?
Of course I do.
But someone has to remain and look after all your territories, and all of your interests here.
I believe you trust me to do this.
I do.
In this last year you have earned my trust in many ways.
I have received another offer of marriage.
Egill Sokkason has proposed himself.
You could do worse.
He has a good turf-cutting business.
At least I'd be warm all winter.
(laughs)
Why don't you offer to marry me, Kalf?
You've made yourself almost indispensable to me.
I have nothing to offer you but a capable head.
Let me be the judge of that.
People would assume that I'd sought the marriage out of ambition.
It would do neither of us any good.
Tell me about Einar.
Einar still hates you.
He continues trying to persuade members of his family to rise up against you and restore the old dynasty.
What to do?
I was thinking how it will be onboard one of these ships.
Sailing across the sea to England.
We have not talked about it yet.
I am not sure I want you to come with us to Wessex.
I am ready.
I have endured many hours of training.
Lagertha herself even helped me.
But what if you are with child already?
If I lost you, then I would also lose my child.
I am coming with you!
You can't stop me.
(boys laughing)
I'm going to cook you little piggies!
Oh... and eat you for dinner.
Whoa!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
(yelling)
(groaning)
(boys laughing)
What are you laughing at?
Ahh!
(laughing stops)
(baby crying)
Please don't stop playing on our account.
Oh, yeah, we had finished.
Oh...
How is Boneless?
Ivar is what he is. You know that.
(crying continues)
(crying continues)
(baby coughing)
(Floki giggling)
We are such a happy family.
And what is wrong with that, Floki?
Families are not happy.
Name me one family which is happy.
Ragnar's.
(giggles) Which one?
Helga: Just look at her.
Yeah, but it makes me too happy, Helga.
You don't love your daughter?
No, that's not what I meant.
That's not...
Well, then explain it to me!
I feel trapped, in all this happiness.
I feel trapped, Helga.
We do not want to trap you, Floki.
If you want to leave us, you should leave.
You're too reasonable, Helga. It doesn't help.
Why are you not angry with me?
Yes, I angry with you, Floki.
But it doesn't help either.
Perhaps when you get back from Wessex you will see sense.
Perhaps I will die in Wessex.
Where are you going?
Away! Just away!
You're so horribly good, Helga!
(Ivar wailing)
Lothbrok: What is the matter with him?
(Aslaug scoffs)
How do I know?
But you see how he suffers.
(voice breaking) And I cannot make it better.
Do you even care?
Yes, I care.
(aslaug sniffles)
(softly) Do you love him?
Of course I love him.
Do you love me?
(indistinct talking)
She's gone.
Now we can talk.
Talk of what, Einar?
Of betrayal, of murder?
(scoffs) No, not with me.
Lothbrok: I know you well, my friend.
And I know what tortures you.
(sighs deeply)
But what choice do you have?
You can neither hide from your God, nor ours.
I suffer from that same dilemma, only in reverse.
We will go together to Wessex and you will be my John the, um...
The Baptist?
John the Baptist, yes.
Wherever you go, I will follow.
Bjorn: Torstein!
Torstein: I have a problem.
Two women. Both claim to be carrying my child.
Is it possible?
(scoffing)
Rollo: Why don't you marry both of them?
Hmm? Take one as a wife, the other as a...
Concubine?
Torstein: No.
They hate each other.
They want to kill each other. Or kill me.
Please, just tell me, when are we sailing out of here?
(grunts)
(men grunting)
(chickens clucking)
(horn blowing)
Floki: Rollo!
You cannot understand! I'm so happy!
I'm so happy we're leaving.
(laughing)
Rollo: Believe me, Floki, I understand completely.
Floki: What have I told you, Torstein?
Always keep that ax in your pants, if you want to avoid troubles. (giggles)
Well, some of us... have to bring our troubles with us.
(indistinct talking)
She wanted to come with us?
I could not stop her.
She reminds me of someone else I know.
(crowd cheering)
(drums beating)
(men shouting indistinctly)
Kalf: Time to die, Einar.
I want to die with an ax in my hand.
As though I had died in battle.
Surely you won't deny me that?
(chuckles)
You're joking.
Why would a man about to die joke about such things?
Will you give me the ax, or not?
Your gift was foolish.
I don't think you'll use it against me.
Oh, why not?
If you kill an unarmed man, then you really are the coward Lagertha thinks you are.
But, in any case, would you really kill your own Earl?
My Earl?
Persuade your family to support me as Earl, and we will get rid of the woman who usurped your uncle.
What does she do for us?
She goes raiding with Ragnar Lothbrok.
I had no idea.
And that is the beauty of it.
Ragnar and Lagertha... talk only of farming.
Farming.
Who wants to go places and farm?
Where is the glory in that, Einar?
Where is the glory in that?

Ecbert: Welcome near!
I bid you all welcome.
Earl Ragnar.
Athelstan: He is King now.
King Ragnar Lothbrok.
What happened to King Horik?
He met with a, uh... unfortunate accident.
Then we are truly equal.
It is my pleasure to feed you and prove the bounty of our Earth.
What has happened to our people who chose to fight for Mercia?
Unfortunately, the forces of my uncle and younger brother have prevailed.
But if you, Ragnar Lothbrok, and you, Lagertha, would join with us I am sure of victory.
(speaking in native tongue)
Ecbert: (in english) Um, King Ragnar, I have given you land.
Let me tell you the truth, as God is my witness, some of my nobles do not agree with what I have done.
They are afraid.
But, I am determined to honor our treaty.
In return, some of you, at least, must fight for Princess Kwenthrith.
(inhaling)
That is not part of our original agreement, but... in good faith, and in hopes of creating a long and prosperous... friendship, I will fight.
But I cannot speak for the others.
(clears throat)
I will fight, alongside these pagans.
For Mercia.
(speaking in native tongue)
(in english) Bjorn?
(speaking in native tongue)
(whispering in english)
All have agreed, except Lagertha.
(grunting)
(whispering) Go and translate to Lagertha for me.
In order to establish the settlement here in Wessex, I need the help of one of your leaders.
A strong leader.
Someone that my nobles will respect.
(translating in native tongue)
(speaking in native tongue)
(in english) She agrees to remain in Wessex, to establish the settlement and to help farm the land.
Ecbert: And you also must stay, Athelstan.
You can speak for all sides. We need you.
I need you.
I trust you more than anyone else.
I think you should stay.
Then I shall stay.
Skol!
Ecbert: You left this behind.
I...
Go on, take it.
(sighs)
May the gods go with you and protect you, my son.
Princess.
I just wanted to wish you and your people good fortune.
My prayers go with you.
Thank you, my lady.
May I touch your hand?
My hand?
They told me you were crucified.
And you still bear the stigmata of Christ.
It's not true.
Then why not show me your hand?
I...
It is true.
I bid you goodbye, wife.
Fare you well, husband. Go safely.
Take care of our child.
And wait patiently for my return.
You do not have to come with us.
You can go with Lagertha and the other settlers.
(sighs)
I love you.
And I think you are already with child.
(laughs)
(man shouting)
(speaking in native tongue)
(in english) Away.
(speaking in native tongue)
(translating in native tongue)
(in english) Are you happy about doing this, brother?
(chuckles)
Since when does any of this have anything to do with my happiness?
Tell me about your uncle.
My uncle's name is Brihtwulf.
Though he calls himself King Brihtwulf now.
He has no right to do so.
He has usurped my crown.
And your younger brother?
His name is Burgred.
We were always close. And I love him.
Then why does he fight against you?
My uncle has poisoned his mind or used some magic against him.
Magic?
Has no-one ever used magic against you, Ragnar Lothbrok?
Think.
A wife? A brother? A friend?
I have been deceived many times, but magic was not the cause of it.
(in native tongue)
(people laughing)
(music playing)
Torstein: Ooh, that I could have her.
I'd marry her tomorrow.
And we'd have lots of children and be true to each other... (floki chuckling) ...forever.
A creaking bow, a burning flame...
Tide on the ebb, new ice, a coiled snake.
The sons of a king, an ailing calf, a witch's flattery.
No man should be such a fool as to trust these things.
Floki: No man should trust the word of a woman.
The hearts of women were turned on a whirling wheel.
To love a fickle woman is like setting out over ice with a two-year-old colt.
Or sailing a ship without a rudder.
Aethelwulf: Whatever my father says, I can't bring myself to trust these pagans.
Their way of life is crude, primitive, ignorant.
They have not been redeemed by our savior's love and sacrifice.
They are like the... creatures of the fields.
I too loved someone in the same way once.
I sat among the reeds, waiting and waiting for my love.
I prized that woman as much as my own life.
Lot of good it did me.
And what do you get from sitting in the reeds, but a wet arse.
(laughing)
I would say, let no man mock another over what touches many men.
Time and again the wise are fettered by beauty.
They ache with love-longing.
Lucky are the fools like you, Torstein, who remain unmoved and free!
(laughing)
(men cheering)
(men cheering loudly)
Aethelwulf: One day will come a reckoning.
It is just not possible to imagine a world in which there is both one god and several.
One of us must be right.
The Lord sayeth, \"I am the way, the truth, the light.\"
(man speaking in native tongue)
(speaking english) He says that the armies of my uncle and younger brother are already assembled up river.
They wait for us.
We will soon be in Mercia, and you must fight for me.
And if you are victorious, I promise that I shall give you something worth more than land or riches.

That is a considerable force, father.
You want to chase your mind, brother, now is the time!

There are many farms on this land for you to take possession of.

(translating in english) He wants us to live in peace.
For that is the future for all of us now.

The forces on the right bank are much smaller than those on the left.
And as far as I can see, there is no bridge.
There is no way the two armies can easily re-join.
We attack your uncle.
Now stay out of our way.
Sound the horn.

Why do you hate your uncle so much?
Do you think that my older brother was the only member of my family who raped me when I was a child?
It was my uncle who first brought him to me.
Since I was six years old, he abused me.
He violated my body and my soul.
And he told me not to resist the attentions of the many men that he brought to me, saying that they all wanted the pleasure...
(Gasping)
They all wanted the pleasure of sleeping with a child.
And the last was my brother, who shared me with my uncle.
And even when I cried and I said that they were hurting me, they didn't stop.
They never stopped.

Do you not believe in fate?
Is that really Bjorn, son of Ragnar, or some impostor who just looks like him?
I only do this because I care about you.
Or because I'm a woman.
(Scoffs) No.
Yes.
Marry me.
What?
I asked you to marry me. What is your answer?
Yes.
I will marry you, Bjorn.
I will marry you.
Good.
(Birds chirping)
(Heartbeat thudding)
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
(Indistinct shouting)
Why did you do that?
It's just the angle of the leg.
Couldn't help myself.
(Chuckling)
Kwenthrith: There you are!
I'm looking for your king.
(Laughing)
Of course, You don't understand a word I'm saying.
(Giggling drunkenly)
Oh, thank you.
(Humming)
(Kwenthrith laughing)
(Men laughing)
No!
At least you understood that! Didn't you?
(Both chuckling)
No.
Lothbrok: Rollo!
Athelstan, ask the King who used to farm this land he has given us.
(In native tongue)
He confesses that he has had to remove several Saxon farmers from their lands.
Then ask him if they will not be hostile to us? And if so, who will guarantee the safety of our own farms and communities?
(In native tongue)
He will personally guarantee our safety and security.
I thank the King from the bottom of my heart.
It was always Ragnar's dream to find land to farm for our young folk, and to live peacefully with others.
Now, it is my dream, also.
(Translating in native tongue)
(In native tongue)
What does he say?
He asks if you are a free woman?
(Indistinct shouting)
They are coming! Let us prepare!
Look at what they've done!
Look at the lead boat.
(Speaking Latin)
My Lord, your army has abandoned you and gone. Save yourself!
Burgred! Beloved brother! Stay yourself.
Wait and I will see that you come to no harm!
Burgred, please, you must trust me!
Abandon your false advisors.
You must not trust her. She killed your brother and she will kill you.
But I do love her.
Survive first, love afterwards.
Come. Come now, or it's too late.
My Lord.
Burgred, wait!
(Grunting)
Athelstan: King Ecbert has arranged for some of the laborers who worked here to help us farm the land.
Whoa.
(Horses whinnying)
(In native tongue)
(Chuckling)
What are they saying?
They're saying their grandfathers used some of these tools.
(Children laughing)
Helga: May I tell you something?
I have had a dream.
I dreamed of a stranger, who was a man, but he had no face. Or none that I could well see.
There was snow on the ground and he was walking towards me through the snow, so his footsteps made no sound.
His arms were outstretched, and in one hand, he carried a ball of flaming snow.
In his other hand...
His other hand was covered in bright blood.
And the blood left a trail in the snow behind him.
Yes.
And the drops were smoking in the frozen ground?
You too?
Yes.
Both of you?
We have all dreamed the same dream.
Were you frightened?
No.
I felt excited.
I felt a sense of expectation.
And when I woke up, I was so disappointed it was only a dream.
You are a volva.
You say you can see things. What does it mean?
I have no idea.
I do not know.
(Thunder rumbling)
I see a harvest celebrated in blood.
I see a trickster whose weapon cleaves you.
I see that a marriage of plow and sword will sustain you, until you become a virgin once more.
(In native tongue)
Athelstan, you should bless this house.
Ask God to bless its new occupants.
Let us pray.
In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, amen.
I am thy Lord, thy God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Out of the house of bondage, thou shalt...
Kalf: Earl Ingstad has left you to farm in England.
What good is that to us?
(Crowd murmuring)
Peacefully, legally, we have removed the Earl that was never here, the Earl that came to power by murder...
(Murmuring intensifies)
And the Earl who has nothing between his legs, but a goat's beard.
(All laughing)
I will lead you as Earl, if you will have me.
All hail Earl Kalf!
Crowd: All hail Earl Kalf! All hail Earl Kalf!
She will come.
Where would he have gone?
Ragnar, my brother is a prisoner of his advisors.
Then where would they take him?
To the town, to get reinforcements.
That is not good.
Go and find the town.
Lead on.

Why did you not go with them?
Judith: Have we any news of our army?
Not yet.
But with Ragnar Lothbrok, how can we fail?
Ever since I saw Ragnar Lothbrok and his kin at my father's house, I've been fascinated by these Northmen, especially by their pagan ways.
You were a monk at Lindisfarne, Athelstan.
But you lived amongst the pagans.
Tell me, what was it like?
Lady Judith, you are a good Christian woman.
How could I describe such things to you?
Try me.
Imagine that the sun shone at night, and the moon during the day.
And then imagine that everything you knew about Jesus Christ was not true, and that the true God was a living man, with a single eye, a cloak, a wide-brimmed hat, and that this man, Odin, the all-father, knew the secret of every heart, and the destiny of all men.
And that he, too, was hanged from a tree, and died and was reborn.
Only, it happened a long time before Christ. Before our Lord.
And do you believe in this Odin?
I've had to ask myself, \"what is belief?\" My Lady.
Stones are much easier to wear than earth.
(Athelstan translating)
May I?
Beautiful.
Ancient One?
Where are you?
(Labored breathing)
(Screaming)
(Whispering) He was bound...
Helga: And bleeding.
So much blood upon him.
So much blood everywhere.
It was only a dream.
Yes. Only a dream.
Halt!
You know of Lord Burgred.
Of course you do.
But where is he?
I don't know.
Where were you riding to?
I had business in Repton.
It must be very important business. You were riding like the wind.
I don't know where Lord Burgred is. Believe me.
(Clears throat)
(Sighing)
I don't believe you. Sorry.
(Whimpering)
I could remove an eye, or some teeth. Do you have a preference?
(Whimpers)
Why don't you just say something?
Mention a place...
(Shouting) A name!
(Groaning)
Even if it's a lie, it might just save your sight for a little while.
(Wailing)
There's an Iron Age fort on top of the Hill of the Ash!
Burgred and his army have gone there.
They're waiting for reinforcements.
All right.
(Sighing) It's strange...
How you always know when someone is telling the truth.
I have no argument with you, my friend.
Let's sup together.
We are not all like the Northmen.
Forgive me, My Lady, I...
I did not want to disturb you.
I was just remembering...
I'm sure you can never forget being an artist. Nor a monk.
Which is why I've come to ask you a favor.
I want you to hear my confession.
I was never a priest, I couldn't...
Bishop Edmund, my confessor, is not here.
And I must confess or live in purgatory.
(Bells tolling in distance)
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
In what ways have you sinned, my child?
I have sinned in thought, but not in deed.
Then your sins are not so great as they might be.
(Whispering) They are still great.
What are these thoughts you've had?
I have dreamed of lying naked...
Beside a man who is not my husband.
And did you just lie beside him, or...
We made love. And I enjoyed it very much.
You've certainly sinned.
Yes.
Who...
Who was this man you lay with?
It was you, Athelstan.
(Gasping)
Kalf: I had a dream last night.
And in my dream...
Ragnar Lothbrok tore the liver from my body...
And began to eat it.
I begged him to stop...
By saying that the liver is the seat of life.
But he just smiled and went on eating, with blood streaming down his chin.
Einar: What did it mean?
Kalf: Who knows with dreams?
Einar: Are you afraid of Ragnar Lothbrok?
What sensible man would not be afraid of a farmer who made himself a king?
Yes, but you, too, had humble beginnings.
And not so humble dreams.
So, you want to be like Ragnar?
I want to be famous like Ragnar...
Yes.
I desire fame above all things.
I want the poets to sing of my exploits as they sing of Ragnar's.
I want the gods to pay an interest in me, and prepare the Bright Halls for my coming.
They say Ragnar is descended from Odin.
He is still human.
If you cut him, he will bleed.
(Coins clinking)
(Clattering)
(Laughs)
(Grunts)
(Coins clinking)
(Crowd reacting)
Hey! You bastards.
What, you couldn't have done better, Torstein!
I don't care about that game.
I want you to cut off my arm.
Why not keep it?
Because it's killing me, stupid.
It's no good to me anymore.
I don't want it.
In fact, I've always hated this arm.
It has to go.
(Exhales and sniffs)
I'll do it.
Ah, Bjorn.
Always so considerate.
A real credit to your father.
But...
I want Floki to do it.
Will you do it, Floki?
I suppose so.
I would do the same for you.
I know.
That is why I shall do it.
Cut off his sleeve.
Come here.
(Exclaiming)
You sure you want to go ahead?
No, not my head. Just cut off the stinking arm, man.
Get on with it.
Too bad it's not your flicking arm.
You could have saved some money.

Earl Ingstad and I would like to thank both of you for your hospitality and kindness.
King Ecbert, we remain in your debt for this gift of land, and hope.
No, I remain in your debt, Athelstan, for, on this journey, you have suffered grievously.
And yet, it is you who has taught me that it is possible to respect two cultures, and to live in amity between them.
Thank you.
Please tell Earl Ingstad how much I admire her and that she is always, always welcome at my hearth.
(Translating in native tongue)
(In native tongue)
She says she likes the necklace.
It is so beautiful, that it must have been made by dwarves.
(Chuckling)
We don't have dwarves in England.
(In native tongue)
She says, \"of course you do. You just don't see them.\"
You did not wait to hear your penance.
Here is my penance. You are leaving.
Is that not a good thing? It saves you from further sin.
So you love our young monk, do you?
I do not love him. He fascinates me.
Well, be careful, Judith, who you choose to be fascinated by.
It is true that the more complicated a person is, the more interesting he is.
But at the same time, the more dangerous he is.
And would you say that about yourself, father-in-law?
Man in distance: I see them!
Man: My Lord.
I know where they are.
Where are they?
On top of that hill.
They're drawing us away from our boats.
Assemble the men.
Aye, My Lord.
Yes, My Lord. Straight on!

He's cut his hand badly, and has asked for our help.
Of course we will help.
Siggy, go and fetch some hot water.
(WHISPERING) Go with the servants.
Helga, go and get some strips of cloth for a bandage.
Will you sit by the fire?
Stranger: Thank you.
You are kind.
How did you do this?
(SIGHS) I don't know.
I was sleeping rough, and... might have caught it on a scythe or a plowshare.
What is your name?
Um, my name is Harbard.
You said you were sleeping rough.
Why is that?
I will sleep wherever I can lay my head.
I am a wanderer, and sometimes people offer me hospitality and I sleep on a straw bed, and sometimes I... sleep rough with the cattle for warmth.
It is all one to me. (LAUGHS SOFTLY)
Is that true?
No.
No, I prefer the straw.
(HELGA LAUGHS)
But do not think that I offer nothing in return, hmm?
I tell stories.
Stories about my own travels.
Stories about the gods.
Or both. (CHUCKLES)
Hmm?
As they say, I... I sing for my supper.
Will you sup with us?
If that is acceptable with everyone.
And to King Ragnar, of course.
Ragnar is not here. He and the men have gone raiding.
But you are welcome to what food we have, and to a bed of straw.
(CROWS CAWING)
(MAN WHISPERING)
You are talking behind my back!
Please do me the honor of talking to my face.
We meant no disrespect, sire, but wondered why, if you're prepared to share our farming secrets with the pagans, you do not, in return, ask them to share their boat-building secrets with us?
And why is it, since we give them land to farm, we do not ask them to convert to the only true God?
Yes, I understand your concerns, but as things stand, the Northmen, in the shape of Ragnar Lothbrok, are currently fighting beside us to help us gain the throne of Mercia, that huge kingdom, for our puppet, Princess Kwenthrith.
Now, who among you would choose not to turf a few farmers off our land, rather than gain, through this alliance, a greater part of England itself?
And besides, who knows how this settlement will fare in the future?
Speak now.
Tell me I've chosen the wrong policy.
That for some reason I am not thinking of our kingdom and its destiny.
Tell me now, if you dare, that I do not deserve to be King of Wessex.
Floki: Why are we doing this, Ragnar?
Why are we fighting for these Christians?
Doing King Ecbert's dirty work for him.
This is not about you, Floki.
It's about our children, and their children.
It is about our people's future.
And I do not want there to be endless conflict between us and the Christians.
You're mad, Ragnar. Deluded.
There can be no reconciliation between our gods, the true gods, and the god that they worship.
One or the other must prevail.
And the triumph of the Christ-God will mean the death and destruction of all of ours.
(LOTHBROK SIGHS)
If you don't want to fight... then don't fight.
Rollo: Both of you, save your breath.
We have a mountain to climb.
Some of us will not see a dawn like this again.
Not here on Midgard, at any rate.
So let us try and speak well of each other.
And remember how much we have been through together.
Well said, brother.

I must fight.
You cannot fight. You are too weak.
What are you talking about?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

As you can see, you b*st*rd, I am perfectly able to fight.
Never been better.
Then what are you waiting for?

(SPEAKING NATIVE TONGUE)
(ECBERT LAUGHS)
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
So you speak our language now?
I speak more than before.
I am gratified and pleased.
As I'm sure King Ragnar will be pleased, also.
I've brought some of my nobles to show them the progress you are making here.
Our people, as much as yours, will benefit from a good harvest.
And to help you prepare it, I've brought you something.
It's a new type of plow.
It does not just scratch the surface of the earth, but it digs deeper, and because of the angle of the blade, it turns the soil over.
Now, we've made some experiments, and when manure is also dug into the ripped and open earth, the crop, and the harvest, increase.
You will leave us this plow?
Yes.
See how you get on.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Ecbert: I like to experiment between our cultures.
Plowing, fertilizing, and... sowing seed are the very basis of life.
Indeed they are.
Well, give this plow to your settlers.
Let them see if it works.
Or not.
You and Athelstan are invited back to my villa, whenever you choose to come.
For now, I bid you farewell.

Harbard: I want to tell you of the time that I went to Utgard.
I traveled east until I came to that band of water that divides the world of men from Jotunheim.
I... walked for many miles without seeing a soul.
But then, finally...
I reached a huge hall.
Large amounts of giants, they were all lounging on benches.
One giant, who I took to be the king, he asked me if I had any skill.
And what did you tell him?
(BURPING)
I told him that I could drink...
(ASLAUG LAUGHING)
And that I doubted whether... anyone in that hall could drink as much as me.
He asked his cup bearer to bring his sconce-horn.
He said some men there took two draughts to empty it, but nobody was so feeble that they couldn't drain it in three.
Did you manage?
I took enormous gulps, until I was breathless. But when I finished, I saw that the level of the drink... was just a little bit lower than when I started. So the king, he asked me if I wanted to try my hand at some other type of contest. I demanded that he let me (SHOUTING) wrestle with someone.
Who did you wrestle?
She... was called Elli. She was his old foster-mother.
(IMITATING OLD WOMAN) She was a horrible old crone, who came in hobbling with a stick.
I hurled myself upon her! But the moment that I laid hands on her, I realized... she was strong. And she caught me in a lock and threw me off balance. I clung to her desperately, but after a struggle, I was forced to one knee... (EXHALES) And so I lost.
Then... what happened to you?
(HARBARD GROANS)
I told the King that he had put me to shame. He confessed to using spells to trick me. He said he could scarcely believe his eyes when I drank from the horn... because the other end was in the sea. He said that when I got back to the ocean, that I would see how much it had ebbed with my efforts.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
And his old foster-mother?
He said it was a marvel that I had withstood her for so long, because Elli... is old age. No one can withstand old age... in the end.
Well, it seems to me, it was not you in the Great Hall.
Then who was I?
Helga: You were the god Thor. Only Thor can drain the seas and fight old age.
(WHISPERING) You're right. I was Thor. (INHALES)
(YELLING) The thunder god!
(HARBARD LAUGHING)
But even so, I was still there. And I saw it all with my own eyes.

(LAGERTHA GIGGLING)
Ecbert: Let us talk about the Romans.
Most of what they built here, now lies in ruins, but... there is another place.
A great city, which the Romans built, and it still stands to this day.
It is a city called...
Paris.
In a land called Frankia.
I visited there with the emperor Charlemagne.
Athelstan: I've once visited Paris myself.
It is set upon an island in the middle of a great river called the Seine.
It has high walls and ramparts all around it, for many miles.
I remember when I saw it for the first time.
It was like a dream, as if it were not real.
A vision.
How far is this city?
Ecbert: It lies on the other side of a narrow stretch of water.
Many here trade with the Franks, and... we still drink their wine.
(LAGERTHA GIGGLING)
What is it?
This is wrong.
It's wrong.
(GIGGLING)
I'm sorry.
What for?
You didn't do anything.
And nothing happened.
(JUDITH SIGHS)
That's the point.
I wanted something to happen.
I wanted something to happen between you and me.
Right there in the water.
In front of them. I didn't care.
It was wrong of me.
I'm married.
I have a child.
I'm a Christian.
Nothing happened and you've done no wrong.
And the Lord understands our weaknesses and our trials.
I am tired, Athelstan.
I'm so tired.
Then go and sleep.
And may the Lord, in his mercy, bless you and keep you...

Torstein has died fighting for a hill he did not want to own.
For something which meant nothing to him.
He has died a pointless death.
How many more of us must die for your Christians?
(TREMBLING) Or have you, in your heart, already renounced our gods and turned to the Christ-God?
Is that what your friend Athelstan has persuaded you to do?
But look.
Here we are.
Under an English sky.
Burying our dead.
Those we have sacrificed for Jesus Christ.
(SNIFFING)
We are all fated to die on a certain day, yes?
But it is our own choice to do as we please until that day comes.
I did not force Torstein, or any of you, to come for that matter.
You all chose to be here.
My heart is as heavy for Torstein as anyone's, but I am sure that I will bump into him again soon.
And in the meantime, Floki, shut your face.

That is what her shield is for.
We fight.
That is how we win and that is how we die.
Do you understand?
But she is with child!
And you let her come?
Hmm?
She will probably die, with your child in her belly, and it will be your fault, because you have the strength of a man, but the will of a little girl.
I can't believe you're my son.
I can't even look at you!
Rollo: I do not think she will die.
She wants to live.
She has a lot to live for.
But if she hears you weeping and lamenting, she will choose to die.
Be strong.
Be a man.
Coax her back from Valhalla.
But make it worth her while, for she is already at the gates.
Kwenthrith: You don't have to worry about it.
Ah, Ragnar. My ally.

Unless they renounce their false gods and heathen ways, we should not allow them to stay any longer.

Siggy: A stranger has come to Kattegat.
His name is Harbard.
It is possible that he is... a magician, or... He has powers of some kind.
Seer: Why do you think that?
Before he arrived, I dreamt of him.
And so did two other women. All of us, the same dream.
(INDISTINCT WAILING)
(SEER INHALING)
Queen Aslaug cannot comfort her son Ivar when he is suffering.
But this man, he...
He takes away Ivar's pain, and the boy goes back to sleep.
If he possesses powers, then he is putting them to good use.
But are you sure?
Two young boys died today.
A fisherman caught them in his nets.
Yes, I know.
Might he not be connected to the deaths of these boys?
Why should he be?
I don't know.
But you would know.
What have the gods told you?
What have you foreseen?
(SEER SIGHING)
The gods have vouchsafed me nothing, told me nothing.
They have neither warned me, nor promised me anything.
And I have foreseen nothing.
But we have foreseen something.
We women, we dreamt that you were...
You were tied up, that you were bleeding, and you could neither move nor cry out.
That is what we saw.
We saw that... nobody could help us.
It's true.
No one can help you.

But are you sure?
Judith: I wanted something to happen between you and me.
It was wrong of me. I'm married.
Ecbert: The Northmen are fighting beside us to help us gain the throne of Mercia, for our puppet, Princess Kwenthrith.
Spare my brother.

It is ended!
How many more of us must die for your Christians?

(SHUSHING)
Ivar, what is it?
Where is Harbard?
I don't know.
You have to find him.
Ivar is suffering so badly. I can't bear it!
Why can't you look after your own child?
(INVAR CONTINUES CRYING)
I am here.
Ivar.
There is no more pain, Ivar.
No. No more pain.
That's right.
(WHIMPERING)
Very sleepy, Ivar.
You're getting very sleepy.
(IN A SOFT VOICE) There's no more pain.
(CRYING STOPS)
Go to sleep.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
No, I don't.
You have such power.
Are you a god?
I wish.
For who would not wish for such a thing?
(URGES HORSE)
Porunn.
So much for Rollo, the warrior.
The hammer to the cross.
Where is your soul?
Where is your belief?
Floki, forget it.
This...
This is the future.
We cannot fight everyone.
There must be cooperation, alliances just as there are among the gods.
That is the way forward.
Well, well.
It seems that the magic of your Christian baptism has worked after all.
You said the whole thing was a joke. Perhaps you took it seriously.
You know very well it was a joke.
No.
I can see that you have all drunk from the poisoned chalice!
And the joke, Rollo, is on you!
I see you are still suffering.
(GROANS)
I can make it better.
How?
Lie back.
What are you doing?
(GROANS)
(CHUCKLES)
I suppose I should thank you.
I suppose that maybe you should.
I may have just saved your life.
Your brother is weak.
He is just a puppet.
And he will be your downfall.
I know what you think about Ecbert.
Do you believe him?
Should I not?
He has always acted in his own interests.
He wants power over me and over Mercia.
I did not fight for him.
I fought for my people, and for you.
How is your wound?
(GROANS)
It still hurts.
(LAUGHS)
Do you need to lie back?
Siggy: Wait!
Where are you going?
Out.
Where? With whom?
It is not your concern.
Oh, it is my concern, since you are once again leaving your children behind.
I know they will be safe with you.
Are you going with him?
Just look after my children, it's all I ask.
No.
What are you trying to do?
I am trying to save you.
It is not just the children.
You have other responsibilities.
Ragnar has left Kattegat in your care.
There are folk who are waiting to see you.
There are important matters to decide.
Let go of your queen.
Then I will do it.
I will accept the responsibility.
I heard a story about a king who was killed and all his family massacred.
But his wife, Astrid, she escaped and fled to an island in the middle of a lake.
I was smuggled onto the island, and I was introduced to Astrid.
She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.
And she was a nymphomaniac.
She needed a lot of s*x.
(CHUCKLES)
I was forced to sleep with her.
Forced?
I heard later that nine months after I left the island, she gave birth to a second son called Olaf.
Now this Olaf is Grand Duke of Kiev and all Russia.
And he is your son?
I am sure of it.
I am forever in your debt.
What you have done for my son is...
Is what I would do for any suffering creature.
Like you.
(CHUCKLES) Me?
I am not suffering.
Yes.
Your husband is a long way away, and you fear he no longer loves or desires you.
How do you know?
Remove your clothes.
It is cold.
Then go back to your children.
I do not want to be with my children.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(MOANS)
There.
It is done.
I am glad.
I love you.
Do you love me?
Yes, I love you.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
What will King Ecbert do to me?
He will do nothing to you, so long as I protect you and Ragnar protects me.
Ecbert must hide his power behind a legitimate heir to the throne of Mercia.
Then he will not have me killed.
No, he will not have you killed.
Burgred, you and I will be joint rulers to the throne of Mercia.
Does that not excite you, hmm?
The Mercians may quarrel against us.
No, they will not.
Behind us are the iron fists of both Wessex and the Northmen.
Do you see?
Then we will be prisoners of Ecbert and Ragnar.
I suppose.
But better prisoners than dead, hmm?
Prisoners can always escape.
It is not his fault.
No, you are right.
It is someone else's fault.
Who's that?
Is it not clear to you, Bjorn Ironside?
Who brought the Christ god into our lives?
Floki says we have betrayed our gods to serve a Christian king and a Christian god.
Unlike Floki, I do not think I can speak for the gods.
All I know is that my desires and ambitions for our people have never changed.
And now that I am King, I must try to bring them about.
What limits did Odin put upon his curiosity?
Who can say?
Exactly.
So unless I seek out those limits, I cannot say that I have honored his spirit.
Floki threatens me with Odin, but I would not be ashamed to meet the god face-to-face.
When Ragnar returns, I am sure he will stay but a short time before sailing back home.
He is, after all, a king.
But you could stay.
To what purpose, King Ecbert?
Well, surely, someone must stay to make sure that the new settlement is successful, the first harvest safely gathered.
Someone will stay to do that.
But even if I am not a king, I am an earl.
I must return to look after my people.
It is fine and it is good to talk of responsibilities, but there are other things in life.
What if I asked you personally to stay?
I have enjoyed your company.
And the s*x.
(CHUCKLES)
Even so, although you have made me happy and fulfilled, I have come to understand that the only person you truly care for is yourself.
Forgive me, Earl Kalf.
There is something we must earnestly consider.
And what must I so earnestly consider?
At some point, if she still lives, Lagertha will return from the raid.
And she will bring with her most of our young warriors, hardened by battle, perhaps enriched by spoils.
And, I assume, loyal to her.
Do you really suppose that I have not considered that?
Do you really think, poor Einar, that I have not prepared for that?
I have invited someone here to join us.
A very significant person indeed.
And he will arrive here very soon.
Very soon.
(WHISPERING)
What are you two whispering about?
Where is our mother?
Your mother goes to Harbard because of your brother Ivar.
Ivar needs your mother more than you do, and Harbard helps her to look after him.
Someday, Ubbe, you will understand what a mother has to sacrifice for her children.
(IVAR CRYING)
(WHISPERING) Let's go.
Where are you going?
(SHUSHING)
They'll be all right.
Where are Ubbe and Hvitserk?
They went out.
I don't know why I feel frightened.
I have to find them.

I have often come across her in the chapel, weeping and privately praying to God for your safe and sure return.
Judith.
Princess.
Ah, come.
Sire.
Sire, this is my young brother, Burgred.
He says that the campaign against us was no fault of his.
Well, I am glad to hear it.
Welcome, Burgred, to Wessex.
Sire, my sister has told me you are a most generous and forgiving monarch.
I throw myself completely at your mercy.
No, no, no.
I meant what I said. You are most welcome.
Please join us to feast and celebrate the happy future of Mercia.
You see, I told you. Come, come.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Forgive me if I do not kiss your hand.
I would not expect it from you.
As I've told you before, we are equals, you and I.
How is the, uh, settlement?
Well, if you want to know the answer to that question, you had better ask Earl Ingstad.
You're wounded.
Ah, yes.
But...
But Princess Kwenthrith gave me some of her medicine.
(SIGHS)
How is the settlement?
It's working. We have planted the first crop.
King Ecbert gave us a new plow, and always assured us of his protection.
And you believed him?
Yes.
So it seems you two got on well, then.
Yes.
For the sake of all of us.
Ah.
So you sacrificed yourself for the common good.
Mmm.
As did you, Ragnar.
I'm hungry.
Hello, brother.
I don't like you.
Porunn.
Hello, Bjorn.
Are you enjoying yourself?
There must be a feast.
Why don't you talk to me?
Poor Bjorn.
You won't want to marry me now, will you?
Don't say that.
(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
Athelstan.
My friend.
The battle for Mercia is won.
But not yet the settlement. Stay. Stay, both of you.
Oversee your future.
What could be more important?
I have told you my decision.
Perhaps Athelstan will stay.
Will you?
I'm not sure.
I've not discussed it with Ragnar.
Hmm, or with Judith.
My daughter-in-law has grown fond of you.
I know it. She has told me.
She sometimes uses you as a confessor.
If you go, she will miss you.
As indeed will I.
They are trying to make you stay?
Yes.
There is something between you and that girl?
Yes.
You don't understand.
Nobody understands.
We're all free to do as we please.
Are we still talking about women?
Mmm.
They say you will go home with Ragnar.
Your husband is back.
I gave myself to you.
Please don't leave me.
(MOANING)
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)
Lothbrok: What will you do with Mercia?
I will crown Kwenthrith and her brother Burgred as joint rulers.
That makes sense.
You see how they feel for one another. Why choose between them?
They will not rule in any case.
Then who will, Ragnar Lothbrok?
You will.
For you have given them the crown.
Well, the important thing for me is that there will be stability in the region.
The important thing for you is that Wessex will have power in Mercia.
Actually, the really important thing for me is that your settlement is a success.
You've helped me in my conquest for Mercia, and I've helped you to establish a settlement in the very heart of my kingdom.
If you remember, it was one of the first things we ever talked about.
I remember it very well.
You and I, we understand each other.
That is why we are allies, and will remain so.
Lothbrok: Do you think you're a good man?
Yes.
I think so.
Are you a good man?
Yes.
I think so.
Are you corrupt?
Oh, yes.
Are you?
Mmm-hmm.
Rollo: Floki?
What are you doing out here?
I came to talk to the gods.
They are angry, Rollo.
And I'm so afraid that we must one day choose between them and your brother.
For me, it will never come to that.
(CROWD CHATTERING)
So... once again, Athelstan, you have to make a choice.
Will you go back with Ragnar Lothbrok or will you stay with us?
I have made up my mind.
I will go back with Ragnar.
All my future lies with Ragnar.
I think that is the wrong decision.
So, you left your earldom.
Are you not afraid?
No, I have a good man who looks after it for me.
Why should I be afraid?
All men are ambitious.
Not Kalf.
Einar: (WHISPERING) Earl Kalf.
Earl Kalf.
Earl Kalf!
Mmm...
What is it?
Your guests have arrived.
(SIGHS)
Erlendur, son of Horik.
How gladly we welcome you to our hall.
How impatiently I have awaited your coming.
I'm most grateful for your invitation, Earl Kalf.
I believe with all my heart that you and I are natural allies.
Yes! Against the Lothbroks and all their kith and kin.
And we have another natural ally.
You may recall that Ragnar blood eagled his enemy, Jarl Borg.
But he forgot to kill Jarl Borg's wife, who subsequently gave birth to a son, and who is now my wife.
Come, Torvi.
Good day to you, Earl Kalf.
Good day to you, Torvi.
And to your son, the legitimate heir of the great Jarl Borg.
My dear brother, my dear Burgred, before all these people, before King Ecbert of Wessex, King Ragnar and King Aelle of Northumbria, let me say that I have made peace with my past.
I have come to terms with my family, with all the violence visited upon me.
And now at last I am free from my anger, saved from my nightmares.
And, finally, I know who I am.
And so, my dear, let us celebrate our alliance, and drink to victory over my abusers.
My dear sister, you have saved me.
I love you.
(LAUGHS)
How I've always loved you.
Yes.
Salutations, my love.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
Burgred!
(GAGGING)
(INDISTINCT)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
My lords, ladies and gentlemen, please rise and raise your cups to the sole and only ruler of Mercia.
To the Queen of Mercia.
To the Queen.
To the Queen.
Why so quiet?
Nothing to talk about?
Not with you, perhaps.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
So you are tired of me already?
Not to worry. It is time for me to be on my way.
I am never anywhere too long.
I'm too restless.
The boy is well.
In future, I doubt he will suffer such pains as before.
I've taken some of his pains upon myself.
And your friend Siggy, she's also very happy.
She's with her husband, sons, daughter in Valhalla.
If you don't believe me, you could ask the Seer.
Farewell then.
Who are you?
Just a wanderer.

All men are ambitious.

At some point, Lagertha will return from the raid.
Do you really think that I have not prepared for that?
I gave myself to you. Please don't leave me.
Athelstan: Your husband is back.
I do not want there to be endless conflict between us and the Christians.
The triumph of the Christ-God will mean the death and destruction of all of ours.
You are once again leaving your children behind.
They will be safe with you.
(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)
Tell me about Paris.
Again?
Please.
I only went there once.
Continue.
I was visiting a monastery in Frankia, outside of Paris.
And one day, the monks took me to see it.
It was amazing.
It just appears as if it rises out of the water.
I've never in my whole life seen anything like it.
It was like a dream.
It has these huge walls, and inside the walls are these buildings made of marble and stone and churches, such churches.
I remember the clamor of their bells, calling the faithful to prayer.
(SEAGULLS CAWING)
But what I remember more is the beautiful women.
You never told me that part before!
I almost questioned my vows of celibacy.
Floki: What are they talking about?
Who?
Ragnar and that priest.
Look at them, huddled together.
It sickens me!
Lothbrok: You are lucky.
Why?
Because you have never been married.
I would not come back here if it weren't for my children.
At least you have children.
Porunn...
What is it, Bjorn?
Are you thirsty?
Porunn: No.
I am not thirsty, or hungry, or really alive.
Who were you hoping to see?
Both: Torstein.
Both of you?
Torstein is in Valhalla.
She will be all right.
Take her.
Where are my sons?
Rollo: (SHOUTING) Siggy!
I have something to tell you.
Siggy!
Siggy!
I said, where are my sons?
Siggy!
Rollo. Rollo...
Where is, Siggy? I can't find her.
Rollo! Rollo...
Siggy is dead.
How?
Ubbe and Hvitserk fell through the ice into a frozen lake.
Siggy saved their lives, but she drowned.
And we could not find the body.
The gods are mistaken.
No, the gods are never mistaken.
This is my fault.
I... I did not treat her well.
It's the truth.
You all know it.
(VOICE BREAKING) This is my fault.
Rollo!
Rollo!
Why was Siggy taking care of our children?
We were taking it in turns.
That day it just happened to be Siggy.
On another day, it could have been me...
I wasn't asking you, Helga.
I was asking you.
Helga is right.
We three women took it in turn to care for all our children.
See, I find that funny considering that Siggy's children are dead.
I must go see Porunn.

Why did you leave Siggy to look after my sons?

Why did the boys walk over a frozen lake?
What do you think made them do it?
They are curious. Just like their father.
Is that all?
What else can I tell you?
Don't you want to have s*x?
What is it?
You had so much s*x in England you don't need it?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Yes.
(CHUCKLES) They can go and work for a Christian king, in a Christian country!
Perhaps they can also become Christians! Why not?
Whatever they choose to do will be up to them.
Who asked you, priest?
Floki!
What?
He is a Christian.
He's always been a Christian.
I don't know why Ragnar listens to him.
It's true.
I don't know why Ragnar listens to me.
Not when he can listen to you, Floki!
Good night. May the gods keep you.
Bjorn!
What?
What do you mean \"what\"? What happened to you?
I got into a fight with my uncle.
You fought with Rollo?
I wanted to stop them killing him.
I don't understand.
It doesn't matter.
Are you going to see Porunn?
No. She does not want to see me.
If she needs me, she will tell me.
She is a woman, not a child.
Good night.
What are you hiding?
I'm not a fool, Helga.
Something happened here when we were away.
Something happened that led to the death of Siggy.
A wanderer came here.
We had all dreamed of him. Aslaug, Siggy and me.
He said his name was Harbard. And he possessed some gifts.
He told stories, and he could cure people.
He cured Ivar of his pains.
His name was Harbard?
Yes.
That is what he said.
And what else did he do? This, Harbard?
He seduced Aslaug. She slept with him.
It was because of him that she was not looking after the children.
And this... He said his name was Harbard?
Are you sure he said that?
Yes, he said that.
But what does it matter?
He took Aslaug away from the children.
It's his fault that Siggy died.
No. Not his fault.
Her fault, your fault, everyone's fault.
What do you mean?
You frighten me.
Harbard is not a human being.
Harbard is a god.
He came to visit.
And such a visit must always be celebrated.
Even if it leads to death?
If it leads to death, it also leads to life.
That is the way with the gods.
That is what Ragnar must understand.
But I don't want to tell Ragnar.
It is not my business to tell Ragnar.
No, no, no.
No, you're right.
It is my business.
(SHOUTING) I must speak to Earl Ingstad!
I must speak to Earl Ingstad!
(HORSE GRUNTING)
I must speak to Earl Ingstad!
Inside.
Earl Ingstad, we just heard of your return.
There is some news.
Your properties, your lands, your Earldom...
All have been usurped.
Say again!
It's the truth!
You have been removed from power.
Forgive me. I am only the messenger.
Who has done this?
Who has usurped me?
Kalf.
(HUSHED MURMURS)
Kalf.
That's impossible.
And yet it has happened.
Kalf has made himself the new Earl of Hedeby.
I supported you in Wessex, now you must support me.
Together we can overthrow this usurper.
Firstly, you came to Wessex of your own volition.
Secondly, if there is a civil war, many of our own people will die.
Is your Earldom really that important to you?
Yes.
Why?
Because it is rightfully mine!
Oh.
Well, there is never much use in arguing with you, Lagertha.
We shall go and talk to him.
Who is Harbard?
Who is Harbard?
Who is Harbard?
You want to know?
I'll tell you about Harbard.
I'll tell you about who he was to your son.
The son you leave behind.
When you went away, Harbard helped him.
He took away Ivar's pain.
Look how peaceful he is.
He's sleeping.
He never slept before.
And it was Harbard who stopped his suffering.
Was he good?
This Harbard?
Yes, he was a good man.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
(SHOUTS) Oh, God!

Son?
What is it?
Nothing.
Then come with me.
So, this man has just come to me.
He is a farmer. He's been helping the Northmen to establish their settlement.
Tell my son what has happened.
There has been some trouble.
Some conflict between the Northmen and some of the landowners.
Nothing much at first.
Boundary disputes. The usual stuff between us farmers.
But then it got serious. There were threats.
I tried to stay out of it.
\"Drink the wine, praise the Lord of all, and let the world be the world.\" That's what I say!
Yes, never mind about that. What happened next?
One of the farms of the Northmen was attacked and burned down.
Some people died.
And what did the attackers say to the Northmen?
They said it was just the beginning.
That they would come back and kill them all.
Now you know that this settlement, and my agreement with Ragnar Lothbrok, mean a great deal to me.
So I want someone, someone I can trust, to go out to the settlement with a large force, and bring these disputes to an end.
But you have just returned to Wessex and to your wife and child.
So, I would understand if you did not want to leave them again so soon.

If you're sure?
I said I'll go.

And I see that its gates are already here, to my eyes.
What does that mean?
It means exactly as I have said.
I do not lie about what I see, King Ragnar, only sometimes I withhold things, for human beings cannot bear too much reality.
Hmm. Then if you can see, tell me if I will conquer Paris.
I can see that not the living, but the dead, will conquer Paris.
Not the living but the dead?
And I also see that the bear will be crowned by a princess.
Which does not bode too well for you, King Ragnar.
(CHUCKLES)
(ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY)
Ooh!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Stop! I don't want to fight you.
Quiet! Quiet.
(TALKING STOPS)
I have made up my mind.
And this year, we shall attack Paris.
Rollo: Paris?
What is Paris?
That is a good question, brother.
Paris is a city in the country of Frankia.
Next!
Why haven't you told us all about this before?
Because I'm telling you now.
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)
I understand that this, this will not be easy.
By all accounts, Paris is a huge, walled, well-protected city.
This is something that our people have never attempted or dreamt of before.
But I have begun to think and dream of it.
Athelstan.
Come! Come!
Athelstan has been to Paris.
And the wanderer who first told me about England, he too told me about this city.
We must find him.
(ALL SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT)
Yes!
For it is good to travel with hope and with courage.
But it is still better to travel with knowledge!
(ALL CHEERING)
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
Man: We will take this place!
What about your promise?
What promise?
To visit my Earldom. To go to Hedeby.
To speak to the usurper.
Kalf!
You know why we've come.
You have usurped my rights and my lands, to whom you were sworn in fealty and trust.
I expect you to hand both land and title back.
(CHUCKLES)
Hello, Kalf.
Perhaps we might discuss these matters privately.
As you wish, King Ragnar.
Please, sit.
I would prefer to avoid the unnecessary loss of lives fighting a civil war with you.
Do you mind if I call you Earl, Kalf?
Uh-huh.
Come the spring, I will be invading a country called Frankia.
And I would like to invite you, your men and your ships, to join me on this expedition.
And if I refuse?
You will lose everything.
Even my Earldom?
You mean my Earldom.
Lothbrok: That is between you and my ex-wife.
And good luck with that.
Won't you sit down, Lagertha?
I know you must hate me.
Just let me say that I was born here in Hedeby.
I belong here and have a fierce pride in being its earl.
I have a better claim than you do even though I share the world's admiration for you.
I'm not sure I believe so much in titles.
A title is only an opportunity to do good things for the folk here.
I want to do that.
You betrayed me.
And the fact is, you planned to betray me.
And you must have planned it for a long time.
I did, yes...
Despite the fact that I desired you.
You desired me?
Yes.
All the time that I was planning on overthrowing you, I desired you.
I never stopped desiring you.
What am I supposed to do with that knowledge?
(CHUCKLES)
What do you want to do?
Rollo: Ragnar was always chosen over me.
By my father. And my mother.
Then by Lagertha.
Why would I not want to betray him?
Why would I not want to scream at him, \"You see, I am alive too!\"
Being alive is nothing. It doesn't matter what I do.
Ragnar is my father, he is my mother, he is Lagertha, he is Siggy.
He is everything I cannot do, everything I cannot be.
I love him.
He is my brother.
He has taken me back.
But I am so angry!
Why am I still so angry?
You tell me, wise one!
Hmm.
Or I will tell you!
It is because I am useless, feckless, hollowed-out by failed ambitions, by failed loves.
Nothing good can ever come of my life now.
(SEER LAUGHING)
What is there to laugh about?
Oh Rollo, if you truly knew what the gods have in store for you, you would go down now and dance naked on the beach.
(LAUGHING)
I don't understand.
I tell you, as I told Ragnar, the bear will marry a princess.
And I can tell you, that you will be present at the ceremony.
Now go and leave me.

(BLEATING)
Kill the Pagans.
All: My Lord.

Aethelwulf: (LAUGHS) Come!
Friends, it was all for this!
It was all for our Lord!
\"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...\"
Where are you going?
I have no idea.
But your father won't fight for my honor or my property.
I cannot stay here.
It seems we have been here before.
Don't try to stop me.
You can leave if you like. You are a free woman.
But don't pretend to me that you don't want to go to Paris.
I know you want to go to Paris.
I've dreamed of the three of us going together.
Do you understand?
Do you understand you're not leaving?
You're a man now, Bjorn.
Act like one!
There are things you do not know about this Harbard.
About this Harbard and your wife!
Helga told me everything.
She told me Harbard would take Aslaug away from her children, away from your sons.
They would go off together.
Then they would sneak into the fish huts and...
Many times.
Helga said she smelled like fish!
That's how it was.
That's what happened when you were away.
Wait! There's more, Ragnar.
There's much more.
Do you not know who Harbard is?
Harbard is another name for Odin.
It was Odin who slept with your wife.
(SIGHS)
The god, Odin, who came to Kattegat.
I am ashamed that my word as king meant nothing to some of you!
That you organized this... this catastrophe among yourselves!
That you took it upon yourselves to violate a treaty that I had signed in good faith!
God knows what the Northmen will make of these terrible events.
My name and my word as King of Wessex will mean nothing to them!
But it cannot be, it cannot be!
It cannot be!
I cannot allow and I cannot tolerate treason.
Guards!
Arrest this man! This man! And this!
And him! All for treason!
And my Lord Radolf. Arrest him also.
Wait, Sire...
For I showed him nothing, nothing but love, and this, this treachery is my reward?
Out of my sight!
(GRUNTS)
And Aethelwulf, you think you will escape so lightly?
All of you! Leave!
I need to speak alone with my son!
(LAUGHS)
Thank you.
Thank you, my son.
You did the business so well.
How could we ever have allowed these Northmen to establish themselves here? It's... It's unthinkable!
And I played my part well, did I not?
Yes, Father. Very well.
And by this ruse, we have now caught out all those nobles who question my rule and we have reason now to rid ourselves of them, permanently.
Mmm.
It worked out well.
No...
It worked out beautifully, my son.
Even Charlemagne would have approved.
Don't you think so?

You can neither hide from your God, nor ours.
Bring these disputes to an end!
Thank you, my son.
You did the business so well.
I always tried.
Whose child is it!
Come the spring, I will be invading a country called Frankia.
And I would like to invite you.
Erlendur, son of Horik.
I have awaited your coming.
If you truly knew what the gods had in store for you, you would go dance naked on the beach.
This year, we shall attack Paris.

Athelstan: This is the River Seine.
Now I don't know where it starts, but it arrives here and it widens.
It widens around this island.
And on this island...
Is Paris.
It has these walls all around.
They are high and thick.
And towers everywhere.
But how do they get into the city?
There was a bridge. At least one. Like this.
What defenses did they have?
I was just a monk.
I did not notice such things at the time.
Well what do you say now?
Now?
I would say this city is impregnable.
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)
It won't be long now.
Go away, Bjorn!
No!
I don't want this child. I don't want this child! I don't want this child!
I do.
It will be weak, deformed.
Maybe you will love it just the same.
It is coming.
Pray to Freya.
(SCREAMING LOUDLY)
(BABY CRYING)
It is a girl!
Give her to me.
Shh.
I am a father.
You have a perfect daughter.
She's the most beautiful child I've ever seen.
She needs a name, your beautiful daughter.
I have a name, if Porunn agrees.
I would like to call her Siggy.
Siggy who saved the sons of Ragnar.
It is alright, sweet Siggy.
May the gods watch and protect you, my sweet daughter.
Floki: Ragnar!
Ragnar!
This man is a farmer, and he has some news for you.
Lord.
His name is Stender.
His farm was in Wessex.
I know, Floki. Let the man speak.
King Ecbert's son, Aethelwulf, came one day with his nobles and soldiers, and killed, burned and destroyed all of our settlement.
All of it, Ragnar!
Go on.
The slaughter was great.
All our men, their wives and their children.
Only a few of us survived.
Somehow we reached the coast.
We stole a boat, and then we sailed through ice and fog.
I just wanted to die, as my wife, my daughter and my little boy had all died, but the gods refused.
Our misfortune was never ending.
Storm blew us off course.
At last we reached a small frozen bay in Gotland.
The ship foundered on the ice.
I saw my eldest son die before my eyes.
And here I am, my Lord, a broken man, who only wants to die and rejoin his family.
Yes, I know.
Do you see now, Ragnar?
This adventure was doomed from the start.
We ignored the warnings of the gods.
And so they refused to protect our farmers.
And who can blame them, Ragnar?
Believe me, Floki.
Aethelwulf and his father will feel the wrath of the gods and my revenge.
And Athelstan?
What about Athelstan?
Athelstan persuaded us to deal with Ecbert and the Christians.
He persuaded us of their good faith.
But now you must see the truth, Ragnar. It was all a trap.
Athelstan is not to blame, Floki.
If anyone is to blame, it is me. Do you understand?
Me!
Look at what the gods are trying to tell us!
Me.
Have you told anyone else about this?
No one, Lord. No one.
You are a courageous man, Stender.
Thank you, Lord.
No, thank you. You are beloved by the gods.
Why...
Yes.
Now you can be with your family.
(LOUD SCREAM)
(GASPING)
You could have had s*x with him in front of the children for all I care.
Just as long as you were watching over them.
(YELLING)
Sleep well, my darling.
(SHUDDERING)
(GASPING)
Shh, shh, shh.
My Lord.
Here is your new son, my lord Aethelwulf.
A boy?
Congratulations.
My Lord.
My Lord.
I want my baby.
You must come with us, to the place appointed.
But I am not dressed. What place appointed? What are you talking about?
You have no choice. It is by the King's order.
No! Take your hands off me!
You're hurting me! No!
My baby! My baby! My baby!
My children need me!
(SCREAMING LOUDLY) No!
(CROWD HECKLING)
Aethel...
Aethelwulf! My husband!
What are you doing to me?
Sire! Sire, please, have mercy. Have mercy!
Please, Sire. Please, I beg mercy. I beg!
My Lady Judith, you have been found guilty of adultery against your lawful husband.
You refuse to admit the offense, but we find sufficient evidence to exercise the punishment advocated by the Holy Book... (BREATHING HEAVILY) that your ears and nose be cut off... (CROWD CHEERING) to make real and visible your crime against law and against nature.
Our Lord Jesus never advocated such barbarism.
Please, please. Husband, father!
Why cannot you show the mercy that our Lord showed to those weak in the flesh?
Please!
No mercy!
Judith, daughter of Aelle, wife of Aethelwulf, you are charged and found guilty of the heinous crime of adultery with person or persons unknown.
You must pray to God for forgiveness.
(SHRIEKING)
Stay!
Judith, will you not give us the name of the father of your child?
(SCREAMING LOUDLY)
No!
Athelstan.
Hold! Hold! Hold!
Athelstan!
(WHIMPERING)
What do you mean, it was Athelstan? What can you possibly mean by that?
(SOBBING)
Athel...
(SOBBING) Athelstan is the father of my child.
No.
Athelstan is a holy man.
I cannot blame my daughter-in-law for being attracted to such a man of God.
Father! Can you not imagine my own humiliation?
I can. But may I suggest that there are deeper things involved here?
In my own mind, there is no doubt of Athelstan's deep spirituality, and his close connection to God.
So you think that God had a hand in this conception?
I do. I do, my son.
So how can we punish a woman who, like the blessed Virgin, has been chosen by God to give birth to a very special child?
(WEEPING)
There will be a Christening after all.
The boy's name will be Alfred.
(GASPING)
Oh, Lord.
Lord.
Christ the Lord!
I've asked for a sign.
You have given me a sign.
You've answered my prayers.
I was blind, but now I see. I was dead, but...
I'm reborn.
(WEEPING) Father.
Hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
(WEEPING)
For the gift of sight.
Lord, thank you.
For the gift of faith.
Thank you.
For by you all things were created that are in heaven, and that are in earth.
Visible and invisible.
Whether they be thrones, powers or dominions.
All things were created by you.
And for you.

Ragnar!
What are you smiling about?
The Lord has come to me.
The Lord?
Your god?
Yes.
What did he look like?
I felt his presence.
He came in the form of light.
Did he speak?
No, he did not speak and yet I heard his voice.
And I am born again.
What do you mean, born again? Like a baby?
I've rediscovered my faith. I'm a new man.
Born again through the love of Jesus Christ.
Then you're a Christian again?
With all my heart.
With all my soul, with all my being.
I can no longer acknowledge your gods.
I suppose it is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean? You cannot leave! You cannot leave me!
I love you.
And you're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Well, I'm happy that you have found your god.
While you are here no one will ever hurt you.
I will protect you.
It does not matter where I go.
What matters to me is where you're going.
Floki!
Why are you not working on the boats?
My heart is not in it.
Why not?
This is Athelstan's sacred arm ring.
The one Ragnar gave him.
I saw him throwing it into the fjord.
Have you told Ragnar?
What's the point?
I feel worried for my father.
I don't understand why he is so interested in the Christians and Christian things.
What are you going to do, Floki?
I am going to leave Kattegat.
I will go home to my own culture.
To Helga and my child.
Don't worry, Bjorn.
I will finish the boats.
And in the meantime, tell our brothers about this.
Who are they?
That's Kalf.
Those were my ships once.
Now they bring Kalf to Kattegat.
Kalf!
King Ragnar!
Earl Kalf.
Greetings.
(CHILD GIGGLING)
I join you in the expectation of the greatest raid in the history of our people.
Who is this chunk of meat?
This is Earl Siegfried.
Lord Ragnar. I put my ships and my warriors at your disposal.
I'm sure that you remember King Horik's son, and the widow of Jarl Borg.
They also have expressed a desire to take part in our raid.
Erlendur. Torvi.
I have to say that... I am a little... caught off guard, seeing you here.
I figured there was a reason you spared my life.
Maybe it's for this.
I have to ask, how is the settlement in Wessex?
Good.
You cannot ignore him.
I'm not going to ignore him.
We are going to fight together even though he took away all that was mine.
All that was ours.
Perhaps it was fated?
And perhaps it is fated that I shall win it back some day.
Lagertha.
I see you are making yourself comfortable here as well.
I have come to join with King Ragnar and you in the attack on Paris.
Whatever else divides us, that simple fact unites us all.
We will fight and perhaps, who knows, we will die together.
And if we don't?
Then we will take care of the future.
My future or yours?
Forgive me, but it seems to me that our destinies are already locked together.
And perhaps always have been! Wouldn't you agree, Lagertha?
Don't hide away.
Why not?
Because there is nothing more beautiful than a mother.
You're drunk!
I want you.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's been a long time.
You need to be with a woman.
Let's find you someone.
Isn't that Torvi, the widow of Jarl Borg?
Erlendur doesn't pay her any attention.
You'd like her.
Don't do this.
You don't understand. I'm doing this because I want you to be happy.
My father says that happiness doesn't matter.
But you are not your father, Bjorn Ironside.
Or have you not realized that yet?
Good night, husband.
Watch it.
Rollo.
I have nothing to say to you, priest.
Except this...
Where is your arm ring?
Where is it?
I have someone very special I want you to meet.
Meet Sinric.
The wanderer I told you about.
It was he who guided me to England.
(IN NATIVE TONGUE)
You speak the language of the Franks.
Not only that.
He also knows how to find the mouth of the Seine.
Are you thirsty?
Yes.
Your husband, he will come to Paris?
And so shall I.
I refuse to be left behind.
You have courage.
I'm Viking.
Sailing south by south-east, we come upon the mouth of the Seine.
The gateway to Paris.
Several rivers empty themselves into the sea, and the reefs and mudflats are dangerous.
But here is the entrance.
The entrance to Paradise.
Floki!
Floki, what are you doing?
I have had a sign.
A sign for what?
A sign that blood must be spilled, a sacrifice be made.
I have waited a long time for such a sign.
And now my purpose is clear.
What purpose?
It is not for you to know.
Some men lust for women, Helga, and others lust for gold, but I only lust to please the gods.
You must tell me what you are going to do.
I will only say that I am going away for a while.
But that no one must see me leave and you must never tell anyone of my going.
Do you swear?
Do you swear!
(CHOKING)
I didn't mean to hurt you.
No. I know.
But I think you mean to hurt someone.
(SINGING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Bjorn.
I'm sorry I have disturbed you.
Don't be sorry.
I love my wife, Torvi.

(YELLING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
The things I do for you.
For such a little man, Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.
This is as close to your God as I can get you.
I never knew what a martyr was.
I still don't.
You were a brave man, Athelstan.
I always respected you for that.
You taught me so much.
You saw yourself as weak and conflicted, but to me you were fearless because you dared to question.
Why did you have to die?
We had so much more to talk about.
I always believed that death is a fate far better than life, for you will be reunited with lost loved ones.
But we will never meet again, my friend, for I have a feeling that your God might object to me visiting you in heaven.
What am I to do now, hm?
I hate you for leaving me.
I ache from your loss.
There is nothing that can console me now.
I am changed.
So are you.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.

Boater: Lord Ragnar.
It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities, I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo, for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
Gisla: Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo, I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden, Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with your Highness.
But I must ask your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is... really much heavier than you imagined.
(Man shouting war cry)
Raise shields!
(Man shouting orders)
Rollo: Climb! Climb aboard!
Row! Row!
King ecbert: Mmm.
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
\"Even those who trespass against us.\"
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And... What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England. Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially. I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god! Father, Aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
(Baby crying)
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
Ecbert: I wonder how he is?
Judith: Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
And how much more she should have suffered for it.
Ecbert: Aethelwulf!
This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this Jezebel!
This harlot!
(Baby crying)
Leave. Now.
Here.
(Snake hissing)
(Hissing)
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
(Grunts)
Father, forgive me.
(Cries out in pain)
Holy Father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
(Sniffing)
Messenger: I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, my Lord.
Death waits for no man!
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
(Groans)
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, my Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always believed in you.
Right this way.
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now...
Now, we all want to know...
Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king... my oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
(Clears throat)
Some of us... have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
Lagertha: I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
Lagertha: I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
(Snickers) Oh, don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
All: Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
(Snickers)
(Aslaug speaking in native tongue)
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
(Sniffling) I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly... unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son, Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely. Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia.
And tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.

Torvi... Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
Let me see!
No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.
Odo: The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
Emporer Charles: Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both, I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in god's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might help to reassure them that we are well-protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, god willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation, and I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo, as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must too go to bed.
Of course.
And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What had I achieved? What could I offer you?
But then I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and... gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal?
If you save Paris, I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Floki: Higher up.
Floki: Pull again, pull again. It needs to be more at an angle.
You must be hungry. I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course... it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
(Horses galloping)
Whoa! Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look! You...
Do as you're told.
If you want to spare your life.
Judith...
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words, here... from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
(Reading in latin)
\"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe, what the gods plan for you and me.
Leave the Chaldees to parse the sentence of the stars.\"
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
\"Of expectation. Life's short.
Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit, Pluck this, here, now.\"
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred. Believe me.
Hm.
(Woman moaning)
(Birds chirping wildly)
(Athelwulf grunting angrily)
Kwenthrith: Prince Athelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
Ah, so much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
(Tuts)
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
(Sighs) So... I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Hm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
(Laughing)
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm... Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh, whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Come.
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son, Prince Magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles... before you killed them... never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards!
(Chuckling)
Queen Kwenthrith, You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex, and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex for the privilege.
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.

Athelstan. I wish he was here with us.
We will manage without him.
The king has asked me to take command.
How do we best attack the city?
Kalf: We'll mount attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
I don't think you were listening.
Bjorn: At the same time as the attack at the gates, there'll also be a river-borne attack.
We will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.

Not when you heard that our beloved city was in mortal danger.

If you care for me at all, Count Odo, you will bring me his head.
You wanted to see me, My Lord?
Yes, yes.
How are you? How are my grandsons?
How is Alfred?
Both are well.
Good.
I have received news that my son and your husband, Aethelwulf, is even now returning home.
His mission in Mercia was successful, I'm pleased to say.
Thank God.
Indeed.
Thank God.
Judith, there are some things that need to be said, but other things which only need to be understood.
I've promised you faithfully that I will protect you and your sons, especially Alfred, against anyone who might offer you or him some injury.
You do understand what I'm talking about, don't you?
We both know what my son is capable of.
My protection I freely offer.
But... (SIGHS) there must be recompense.
Recompense.
My Lord... Some reward?
Of course...
Some reward.

My God. My God.

Your Highness, in the last few days over 200 of our citizens have succumbed to this unknown sickness and died.
God knows how many more will likewise die.
What's more, we're running out of fresh vegetables, fresh fruits.
The city is beginning to starve.
And yet, we won a great victory?
Odo: We may have repelled the pagans and stopped them from entering the city, but that is not exactly a victory.
Who knows? The next time they may well succeed.
Your Highness, we have lost too many good men.
(SNIFFLING)
What is your advice?
I believe we must attempt to come to terms with them.
There is, alas, no other way.
Father, I beg you, ignore this counsel of despair.
We should never give in to these vile pagans, to these brutes.
Otherwise we will have failed, and that is how we would be judged.
Your Highness, I think you must...
Allow me some time to decide!
I understand both these points of view, but I must pray alone and try... and try to discover the will of God.
(RAIN FALLING)

A toast to my son.
I give thanks to God for your success and safe return.
Thank you, father.
I confess to you that Queen Kwenthrith tried to use her female wiles upon me, but with God's help, I managed to resist the devil's snares.
I always knew she'd try to win you over that way.
It's in her nature.
It's what she does.
But I also knew that you would be able to resist her, for your morals and faith are such as even I look up to.
I'm sure your wife is also happy to hear that you avoided temptation.
(GASPING) Of course.
But... I am not so much of a hypocrite as to say so.
No longer be afraid of that.
However painful it was for me, what happened between you and Athelstan, was God's work.
It was for a higher purpose.
And although I can't even guess at that purpose, I am prepared to bow before God's will.
I praise your attitude, my son.
If only we were all so humble and so righteous.
However...
There is something I need to ask you, father.
And you must forgive me, but there is no help for it.
I need to ask you whether you were prepared, secretly, to let Kwenthrith kill me as the price you were prepared to pay for the conquest of Mercia.
I was not.
And frankly the accusation shocks me.
Let me say this to you, no Saxon king has ever managed to hand over their kingdom peacefully and successfully to their son and heir.
But I intend to be the first.
And what I intend to pass on to you is not only the kingdom of Wessex, but the Kingdom of England!
Well, let me, in turn, raise a toast to my father.
The most loving, loyal, and true father in the world.
(GLASSES CLINK)

King Ragnar, the Franks want to discuss a way to end the siege.
Why?
They believe it would be better for both sides.
Why would that be better for us?
They don't believe you are capable of breaching the city walls.
I say we are!
What will they give us if we lift the siege?
That would be decided at a meeting between you and the commander of the city, Count Odo.
Bjorn: And where would we have this meeting?
Because I know that if my father enters the city, he will be captured or killed.
The Count suggested the meeting take place outside the city walls, with no weapons.
Tell them they'll have their answer tomorrow.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Why should we make any kind of deal with them?
Bjorn: We've lost nearly a thousand men, we can't breach the city, and winter is coming.
Do you need more reasons?
Why do they offer terms, if they are so sure we can't get into the city?
They have probably run out of food.
Then we should let them starve.
Ah, then they will hate us even more.
(ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)
I have something to say.
I did not become earl because I aspired to be one.
It came about because of other peoples' actions.
And I did not become king out of ambition.
But once again I had no choice, as a result of other people's actions.
But nonetheless, I am king.
King Ragnar! Hmm.
That is my name. King Ragnar!
What does a king do, Bjorn?
He rules.
Ragnar: Yes!
Good. He rules.
And as a ruler, I...
(SOFTLY) ... have the last say.
Me!
Not you! Not you!
Not you! And not you!
You have all had your ideas, and they have all failed!
I will not. (GRUNTS)

There is something I also seek that has no tangible worth, but to me is more precious.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I want to be baptized.

That is not your decision to make.

Not in his heart.
You saw what you saw. And I heard what I heard.
But you too, were baptized, Rollo.
It did not change you.
I did not want it to change me.
The gods protected me from the Christian magic.
But they refused to protect Ragnar.
Why?
You know why.
His name was Athelstan.
Do you think is true?
What they're saying about Ragnar?

Because no Christian king will ever be allowed to rule our world.

But because we intend on raiding Paris again in the spring, it is important to maintain some sort of presence here.
I will stay.
Rollo: No.
You have no reason to stay here, Floki.
And what reason do you have, Uncle?
Then it is decided.
You will winter here with the rest of the warriors who decide to stay with you.
Emperor Charles: It is wonderful to be able to eat good food again.
These snails are so plump, so juicy.
You know that the Northmen have not all left.
The great warrior called Rollo has remained in the camp.
But most have gone.
Yes...
But they will return again.
That is why Rollo has remained.
They will return in the spring, probably in even greater numbers.
Surely one of your brothers will come to our aid?
I have been weak enough to send messages to them.
I have begged and pleaded our cause to no avail.
Their hatred for me turns out to be the supreme and guiding principle of their lives.
So, what are we to do?
I will not be known to history as the French emperor who presided over the destruction of Paris.
I cannot and will not allow such an intolerable fate to befall our beloved city.
You will have to offer them even more money.
(CHUCKLES)
I will have to offer them even more than that.
I must offer them something far more precious to me than gold or silver.
I must offer your hand in marriage.
This is Count Odo's doing.
Just because I refuse to marry him, he wants to have me thrown to the dogs.
Will you not consider it, my child, for the sake of Paris?
I would do almost anything for the sake of Paris.
I would kill myself for the sake of Paris.
But I will not be tied in holy matrimony to someone who is more beast than man.
Then I will have to recall our deputation.
You have already sent an envoy to make this offer?
Without even asking me?
Without even thinking of me?
Oh, Father!
I am your father.
But I am also the Emperor of Frankia.
And it is not your father who asks this of you, it is the emperor.
And therefore, you will obey him.
You will be offered a vast area of land in the northern part of Frankia.
The emperor will also make you a duke, the highest honor he can bestow.
You will be very rich, and you will be very important.

I'm fascinated by the Viking mindset and the Viking world.
I love digging into the raw material and waiting for stories and characters to emerge.
Hail Earl Ragnar.
I'm not making a documentary, but I do want authenticity.
And I want to get as near to the truth as I can.
Ragnar Lothbrok, I've heard that name before.
Hail Earl Ragnar!
Hail Earl Ragnar!
Well, clearly I needed a hero for the series.
I needed a lead character.
And so I was looking for an important Viking.
I was looking for a Viking who made a difference.
But with the Vikings, obviously, there is plenty of debate about who is who and what was what and what happened, because the Vikings were a non-literate culture. they didn't write anything down themselves.
This is a real cultural treasure, this manuscript.
It's written around 1400.
It was given as a gift to the Danish King.
What is special about this manuscript is this is the only complete manuscript of Ragnar saga that we have.
The saga tells about Ragnar as a young man going on raids and acting in wars, what he has achieved, how many people he has killed, how young he was when he went to war for the first time.
And his fearlessness.
The historicity of Ragnar Lothbrok, did he exist or not, is also one of the endearing puzzles of Viking's culture.
A big part of Ragnar's story is the story of his sons and people like Bjorn Ironside were real, they were absolutely real.
We know this.
We know of the things they did, the adventures they had.
Your father is Ragnar Lothbrok.
For so many known real Vikings to have claimed the same person as their literal father, that's not going back very far in time.
Your father is a person that people would have met, that to me argues that he has a basis in fact.
Ha!
Do I think Ragnar existed?
Yes, I think he did, but I don't think that we are able to know much for certain about him.
One of the central characters in the TV series is Lagertha, Ragnar's wife.
Ida, is your mother teaching you how to use a shield?
(Shouting)
Yes, I know how to use a shield.
Your mother was a famous shield maiden.
Was?
Is.
I discovered that there was a certain amount of ambivalence in the books I was reading about shield maidens, and whether they really existed.
Vikings society's attitude towards women was far more enlightened than the Francs or the Saxons.
You bear a strong resemblance to my ex-wife.
Women could own property, divorce their husbands, fight, rule sometimes.
It seemed perfectly logical, therefore, that they had to fight.
(Shouting)
So, I was quite determined, from the start, not only to have a major female character, who wasn't just going to be a housewife, but to have women fighting alongside men.
Shield wall!
There was some pushback on that.
There was some resistance to that idea.
It's always been a source of great controversy in Viking studies that is, whether these women, these warrior women, were real or a part of the mythology.
These are great warrior heroines doing brave things, and sacrificing themselves for the sake of their lovers or taking power in their own right.
The gods are always smiling at brave women.
Like the Valkyries, those furies who men fear and desire.
I know that you prefer her because she's a shield maiden, a warrior.
The classic image of the shield maiden is very much one that derives from the written sources.
So these are after the Viking age.
The key question is how valid are they for the Viking age itself?
And from those texts, quite frankly, we can't really say.
They might go back to real living people who did this.
They might be heroic embellishments.
But the way to try and nuance that picture, to go back to the real Viking age, is to look at the archeology.
Now, we find a lot of these.
They're all from the late 9th and 10th century.
The design is of a figure on a horse, with a standing figure in front of the horse.
And both of them appear to be female.
And the really crucial thing about these is that both of them are armed.
And just from these alone, we can start to make tentative reconstructions of what these kinds of figures would have looked like if they were real.
What does it mean?
Because it quite clearly meant something in the Viking age.
The first thing that we can say about this is that the idea of the armed women, is absolutely there in the Viking mind.
But that still doesn't tell us whether or not these depict supernatural women or whether there really were female warriors in the Viking age.
(Swords clanking)
Now we come to another new find, that was actually dug out of a block of frozen soil, in new year 2012.
So a very recent find at a place called Hornby in Denmark.
And for the first time, instead of these two dimensional, flat pendants, we find a three dimensional actual model of a warrior woman.
She has the same facial features of other pendants that we find with female faces.
She's holding a shield with the same swirling patterns that we find on these flat ones, and a sword.
What archeology is now starting to show is that there are images of armed women from the Viking age.
Shield wall!
(Shouting)
For a long time, we've known that there are occasional finds of the burials of women with weapons in the grave.
But we haven't been finding what we would call warrior burials of women.
Until relatively recently, when a grave from a site called Birka, a grave excavated actually in the 1870's, so a long time ago, absolutely packed with weapons.
We can see it here, two shields, a sword, two spears, an ax, a fighting knife.
And for a long time this has been reconstructed in the books and exhibitions, as one of the absolute classic warrior graves of the Viking age.
Fine.
But, recently, a team of osteologists, these are archeologists specializing in the study of bones, lead by a very talented Stockholm researcher, called Anna Shelstrom, has been looking at the skeleton from this grave.
And I'm sure you can guess what I'm gonna say.
It's the body of a woman.
So, this is a woman buried with this massive collection of weapons, on the same basis as we tend to interpret most graves.
This would be the burial of a shield maiden.
When we take the two dimensional figures, the new three dimensional figures from Hornby, and the grave from Birka, that adds up to a pretty compelling picture of what these warrior women may actually have looked like.
And the really important part of this is that all these finds are from the Viking age itself.
These are not from the literary text world of the saga's.
This is the Viking age as it really was.
Shield wall!
I have to be clear that there's a range of scholarly opinions on this.
But certainly I think it's quite probable that these women were real.
Halt!
You must be the famous shield maiden Lagertha.
And they say that you are now an earl in your own right.
How did it happen?
I killed my husband when he invaded me.
(Laughing)
The great hall was central to Viking society.
I remember when this great hall was always full of laughter.
(Laughing)
In some ways it's a metaphorical place, and it's a symbolic place.
(Distant chatter)
It's a metaphor for a lot of the politics that goes on, the conspiracy, the murders, and these raids.
And it's symbolic because, you know, it symbolizes a lot of Vikings values.
It is our custom to celebrate such an alliance as the gods celebrated theirs.
Skol!
We're feasting and with pledges.
Skol!
The bonds of loyalty, of obligation, of hospitality, are the cement that holds Viking society together.
And the great hall is the arena where all those things were played out and displayed and spoken of and demonstrated.
Neil: And here we are in Lejre, where we have some of the largest Viking age holes ever found.
What we've just stepped into here is truly a residence fit for a king.
Definitely.
So, we're looking at what, five meters of timber above us here?
Yeah.
With roof supporting posts in the middle.
And these posts, they're almost tree's aren't they?
Anna: Yep.
I mean they're huge things, like this...
There probably would have been a kind of partition wall here or something.
You don't walk directly into the hall, which I think is very important in these houses, also that they show that access is controlled.
The king had his own seat in the hall.
The high seat.
The high seat, yeah.
You would probably have benches along the walls.
I've probably just walked through the fire.
It's not very wise.
(Laughing)
Neil: So you have a big rectangular fireplace in the middle of the structure and this isn't just like a small wood fire, these are big, big things.
We're talking about something that would have been this wide and really long.
A big blaze of light in the middle.
So the hall is the absolute centre of Viking life.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Here we are in a very wet and tough walk.
Can you tell me what we're seeing here?
Ya, I mean it might not look like much, but we're right in the middle of a huge Viking age settlement.
It's going all the way up to the green barn over there.
There's a small dip where the settlement stops, and it goes all the way into the next field as well.
This is not a culture that left behind enormous monuments like The Coliseum or the Taj Mahal.
This is a culture that built in wood, leather things like that.
And these are all things that rot away.
So our knowledge of the Vikings comes from excavations of their settlements and their graves.
So Anna, this is material from your excavations at Toftegaard.
It is, it is.
This is quite high end stuff.
Not every family would have had something like this.
You dip this into the pot and bring out your big chunk of meat.
It's finds like this that, apart from anything else, tells us about the status of this place.
Because, of course, everybody has to eat, but not using utensils like this.
No, no, no, no.
So you can see how finely made this is.
You can see the traces of decoration in the centre there.
This twisted band.
The feast.
Feasting is a big component as to what goes on in these buildings.
You would receive the hospitality of the lord of the hall.
Skol.
But, in return, you would pledge a loyalty to him, either in terms of, contributing to the upkeep of his community or, more particularly, in war.
Now, who will be the first to drink in celebration?
It's better without the bag.
This is really interesting.
Neil: Oh, wow!
Heavy, too.
Ya!
It was guilded.
So this originally would have been shiny and bright like gold.
When we're talking about the halls, they are very dim environments.
They're lit by the fire, and this kind of jewellery...
The firelight would reflect off it.
So people are walking about and they'd shimmer as they moved.
I wanna show you this bit.
Anna: It might not look of much, but I think it tells an interesting story.
It's probably a rim of a bowl and it's probably looted.
We can see that, from the art, that it comes from the British Isles.
Neil: This is quite possibly a monastic object, actually from the monastery.
And given the date of Toftegaard, which is the late 8th century.
This is exactly the time of the raids on the British monasteries.
So they're proper Vikings.
(Laughing)
Don't mess with them, no.
Neil: The lord would redistribute that wealth.
You know, you helped me with this raid, here are rings and bullion and all kinds of loot.
And that would also then trickle down into the rest of society.
This is also what makes it a bit unstable, a little bit dangerous.
What a hoard is this.
What a hoard it is!
And the earls, they only existed and survived as long as they provided for their people, in other words, as long as the raiding parties were successful, as long as they were strong.
If they weren't, they were just disposed.
It was just as simple as that.
The world is changing, and we must change with it.
People are ambitious and they like to go up the social scale.
So it's a society that's in a constant kind of tension.
I've even heard some people say that Earl Ragnar is becoming like Earl Haraldson.
People would rather like to get up there, and the people up there would rather they didn't.
But they still need them in order to maintain their own position.
And all of this is being acted out in the space of the hall.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Do you imagine ships such as dead things?
(Waves crashing)
We've blown miles off course.
Who knows where we are.
I joke about many things, but never about ship building.
It's my fault, and the gods love my faults.
The ship is like the symbol of the Viking age.
It's amazing to me that nobody else had boats anything like them.
The Saxons had no way of protecting the coastlines or rivers from Vikings.
One fantastic thing about the Skuldelev ships was that it represented five different ship types.
Finding these fantastic Skuldelev ships allowed us to build reconstructions and then we could do experimental archeology by building them, by sailing it.
I've just noticed some of the repairs.
There is actually one right here.
It's a bit difficult to see from the outside, but we can try it.
Here you can see the plank.
It's one plank put into another plank.
There is a new overlap here.
That is exactly how we do our repairs.
I can tell which trees would make the best planks just by looking at them.
I can look inside the tree.
This is one.
When you cleave a plank out, you make it very strong because you follow the grain in the tree.
And that's the problem with the saw, it would just cut straight.
So it would cut all the fibers in the tree and that's not only the planks, that's also all the curved pieces.
You have to go into the forest, find the right piece of curve.
You're not cutting over the fibers if you have the right shape of piece.
That's why it's so important for boat builders if they find the right piece in the forest of an oak tree, you have to bring it home.
The advantages of clinker build is that the two planks, when they overlap, then the overlap it's kind of a strength itself.
It's not stiff, the result is flexibility.
And if you think like in your modern head, that you have to build strong and stiff, it will break when you're going into sea.
This means the boat won't butt against the waves like a goat, but move over them like a ripple.
It's not as if we can experience exactly the same things as the Vikings did, but you get an idea.
And that is how we use experiments here at the museum, because you go out and you get an impression of what it is like being on board the ship, instead of, you know, sitting behind a desk and just reading about it.
When I was on board as a crew member
I functioned as a mid-ship man, which means I was located here in the middle of the ship, around the mast.
What I experienced there was that I tried to get an idea of the special conditions of being on board such a long and narrow ship as this is.
Crewed with 60 people.
This is where you would have the helmsman, and you would have the skipper or the captain in that sense.
The crew see's it here, would work with the sheets, controlling the sheets of the sail.
In front of the ship, the very front, you have the lookout.
Which has a very important function on the ship.
Hoist sails!
You can imagine 60 people here in this very long and narrow ship.
And you would have a big square sail.
And you would have the elements out there when you're sailing the ship.
Then it's basically impossible for the lookout here to shout all the way to the aft of the ship.
Jump ship!
And the way that it has been solved when we are sailing with the Sea Stallion, is that we have used a middle man.
<U+266A>
By direct orders from the skipper and the helmsman, which need to be known by the whole crew.
Sail down!
The whole experience of being on board, being able to be a part of that crew...
Heave!
...trains you into becoming sort of a very coherent military unit.
So, my theory is that being on board these ships could be seen as a training camp.
The ships are shaping the crew.
(Shouting)
It might be part of the success that the Viking has in the military of raiding, was basically that they were sailing on board these ships.
This is a place of God!
Viking raiders were very real and very bad indeed.
There should be treasure.
But that's very much a tiny fraction of the whole picture.
Proper Vikings, real Vikings they're quite special people.
Quite unusual people.
Neil: So this is very much the top end of the scale, but, when you go down to the ordinary farmers building, it's the same traditions of hospitality, and the importance of the hearth and the home, but just at a different scale.
To friends and freedom!
The characters break the mold of historical truths.
I like that sense of getting a character who clambers out of the coffin of historical necessity and starts to be real.
And starts to be plausible.
It's the way into the Viking mindset and the Viking world.
Hail Earl Ragnar!

We can just as easily unmake you.
Why can't you accept Lagertha?
Because it was not part of the agreement!
You stated your desire to overthrow all the Lothbrok dynasty and we believed you.
And so did Erlendur, who is with us.
Now it seems without consultation with anyone, you have changed your mind!
I understand.
I didn't realize that you and your family were quite so antagonistic to the new arrangement.

(NOBLES MUTTERING)
We have some unexpected and urgent news from Mercia.
We have heard that several leading Mercian nobles, refusing to pay homage to us, have risen in revolt against Queen Kwenthrith, and overthrown her.
(MURMURING)
As far as we know, she and her son Magnus have been imprisoned in a tower somewhere.
Meanwhile, these rebel nobles have set themselves up as a Ruling Council!
(MURMURING)
This flagrant abuse of our last treaty with Mercia cannot and will not be tolerated.
I've already sent word to King Aelle, our ally, summoning him here.
It may be that this time we will have to use force to overcome Mercia.
But not before we have made a last attempt to rescue the Queen and her son.
You will have to find the tower first!
(MURMURING)
My Lord, we have already dispatched scouts.
We await their report.
In the meantime, we charge you all to give warning.
Summon your men and your supporters to arms.
But if, Prince, they may well not be needed, it would be a great and unnecessary expense to keep good men idle and at arms.
(MURMURING)
Whatever the expense, my Lord, it is surely better to be ready to seize the moment when it arrives, rather than see it wasted and gone.
You are a king's son, what do you know about the burdens of expense?
(MURMURING)
Ecbert: My Lords, you talk as if it were an expensive luxury to keep a standing army.
But I warn you, it is rather a necessity, for Ragnar Lothbrok, or others just like him, could return to these shores at any moment!
I beg you, cease your quarrels.
We are talking about the destiny of Wessex!

Then how can you trust him?
He was a nobleman.
He told me he refused to join the Ruling Council.
What was his name?
I only knew him as \"W.\"
Ecbert: \"W?\"
Yes, Sire.
And still you trust him?
Yes.
Of course he's a member of the Ruling Council.
They're using Kwenthrith as bait.
It's obvious.
It's obvious to you.
What does that mean?
Well, it's the way you think.
Not everyone thinks like you, Father.
Then you are prepared to trust this man's word, and go with him to Mercia?
(HORSES NEIGHING)
You go with some of our best warriors.
God also goes with you, my son.
And...
If you have any cause to doubt the honesty of your scout, then think as I would think.
And kill him, without conscience.
I will bear your advice in mind, Father.
And, whatever else, save the son!
Save Magnus.

Now I trust you again, our parting feels less sorrowful.
Aethelwulf: Let's go!

(SCOFFS)
I have just seen my husband ride away into the greatest danger.
Judith, whatever happens, I...
Just because you are King, you must not presume that things will go on as before.
I never assume anything.
After all, you cannot force me to share your bed.
Well, I would not dream of forcing you.
Force is only necessary against one's enemies.
And besides, I want you to be free.
Free?
Yes.
Not just protected... but free.
To be yourself.
I can imagine that you have never been free in your whole life.
Not since you were born.
Being a princess made it all the worse.
You've lived in a gilded cage.
But, a cage... all the same.
It's true.
I was not free to choose my husband.
You might have chosen otherwise?
(CHUCKLES)
Possibly.
And do you suppose any other prince would have allowed you to be free, hmm?
So, when you say \"free,\" what is it you mean?
How can I be free?
(GIGGLES)
Let me...
Let me ask you something, Judith.
What do you really want?
What do you really want to do?
If you were free to choose, what would give you the most pleasure and satisfaction?
Go on, say it.
Whatever you're thinking.
I'd like to be a painter, like Athelstan.
Very well.
Then I will find you a great teacher to instruct you.
(SCOFFS)
I don't believe you.
Why not?
Because no woman has ever been allowed to study or work on the sacred texts.

(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
He's telling us to build more boats capable of attacking the Northmen in the water.
Count Odo: Hmm?
Good.
So, after today, it seems I have two reasons to be pleased. Firstly, Duke Rollo's sound and interesting advice for the protection of Paris. And then, secondly, Princess Gisla's horror at marrying him.
(CHUCKLES)
Mmm.
I'm sure she will soon seek to have the marriage annulled, on the grounds that it was never consummated... whether that is true or not.
I have to ask, Count, whether you are not bitter that the Emperor is claiming all of the credit for saving Paris?
Of course.
I confess the sight of that little man basking in the glow of his success makes me feel physically ill.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Especially when I recall how cowardly he was during the siege.
You remember that, don't you?
Paris deserves a much stronger, braver Emperor.
Let me drink to him.
Tell me... Do you think that his daughter is really any braver than he is?
What do you mean?
She was brave enough to fetch the Oriflamme.
Your desire clouded your judgment, for she is clearly not what you suppose her to be.
And, frankly, a man brave enough to be Emperor needs a consort with real iron in her soul.
(CHUCKLES)
This is more of a brute than we have used before, and it will hurt you more.
Are you sure?

Do you know anything of this?
Yes.
Yes.
King Ecbert told me he would ask for a teacher.
I didn't really believe him.
May I ask who you are?
I am the wife of Prince Aethelwulf, King Ecbert's son.
Then perhaps it is one of your sons who needs my services.
Actually, it's not one of my sons...
It's me.
That is... not possible. (CHUCKLES)
What's not possible?
To work on sacred texts.
To teach the sacred mysteries to a woman?
It's what you were hired for.
Go and ask the King.
(GASPING IN PAIN)
The Count, for all his jealousy, is impressed by our Northman.
Our new Duke Rollo.
He spoke about him a great deal.
Did he speak of anyone else?
He spoke of the Emperor.
Was he... indiscreet?
He talked of his utter contempt of the Emperor.
Is that indiscreet?
I must congratulate you on extracting such useful information, though, of course, I regret the price you have to pay to get it.
Now, see if you can find out anything else about Odo, which will discredit him in the Emperor's eyes.
Then, when the time is right, I will inform his Imperial Highness of the duplicity and treachery of his high and most trusted servant.
And then?
Then, let the cards fall as they may.
No, no, no, keep... keep, keep pouring.
Thank you. Very good.
(CHUCKLES) It's very good. Very good.
Ecbert: Bishop Edmund, allow me to introduce a new member of our community.
This is Father Prudentius of Troyes.
Father Prudentius... welcome.

(SHEEP BLEATING)
Prudentius has come to teach us some of the secrets of illumination.
Ah!
When Athelstan left, he left many sacred texts unadorned and unfinished.
I regard it as my holy duty to complete that monk's work.
The King has told me a great deal about him.
I also desire that Prudentius should teach Judith to illuminate.
He is troubled by the idea.
Prudentius: You are a Bishop of our Holy Church.
Surely you agree that it would be immoral?
Well?
God... saw fit to allow a former prostitute to wash the limbs of his own son when He was brought down from the cross.
If He tolerated such a woman touching the sacred flesh, how much more would He approve of a good and pious Christian woman adorning His sacred texts? Hmm?
Free.

I've said it all.

She was left alive in the pyre, her flesh totally untouched.

She was beheaded.
Her naked body was thrown into the Forum.
However, God sent a blanket of snow to protect her modesty.

Their leader was the famous Viking, Ragnar Lothbrok, wrath of God, who even pretended to be dead to get inside the walls.

The son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Yes, and heir to the throne of Mercia.
Come inside. Eat, sleep, bathe.

You are safe now.

Yes.
But what does it mean for Mercia?
And how do we restore legitimacy to such a fractured and wounded kingdom?
Well, you have to invade.
Northumbria and Wessex together must defeat the Ruling Council.
And you will once more be Queen.
Of course.
With you to thank.
And your son Magnus will be heir to the throne.
The son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
I once swore an oath, before God and all his angels, that one day I would kill Ragnar Lothbrok in revenge for his unprovoked and merciless attack upon my kingdom.
And would you kill his b*st*rd son, as well?

Put it in there.
I don't want to.
Good boy. No, you can do it, it's all right.
Do it! Don't stop.
Give him to me.
What are you doing?
He doesn't want to do it.
Stop treating him like there's something wrong with him!
Let him join in with the other boys and be like the other boys.
But he's not like the other boys!
He's different. You can't make him what you want.
You can't make him like you. He's not you!
If you treat him like a cripple, he will be a cripple.

Duke Rollo, by the powers vested in me by his Holiness the Pope, I have come to serve upon you the papers of annulment, formally ending your marriage with the princess Gisla.

Of course I appreciate, Abbot Lupus, that this...

What do you know, old man?
I understand. I have learned your language.
Princess Gisla, I beg you not to do this.
I know my destiny is to be with you.
And I swear that, like you, I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
Leave us.
I have come all the way from Rome. Surely...
Surely you will find refreshments elsewhere in the palace.
I do thank you for your pains, such as they are.
Leave us.

So, you have confessed your love and devotion.
Let me ask you something, Rollo, now we can speak to one another.
And I don't pretend it hasn't touched me that you have learned our language.
Let me ask you what is more important to you...
Our marriage, your appointment by the Emperor...
Or your Viking soul?
Did I not kill all my own warriors?
Yes, but I think that is a very Viking thing to do. No?
It wasn't personal.
I don't know if it meant anything to you.
This means something to me.

They separated me from my brothers.
And they...
Raped you?
No.
(GASPS)
They did not dare to rape me.
Why did they not dare to rape you?
They took me on a long journey, for days and weeks.
And afterwards they sold me to the Franks.
And now, I am here.
I am here, wherever \"here\" is.
And it's so long since I knew where I was, or where I belonged.

We are met to decide how to deal with Mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now is a full-scale invasion of their kingdom.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring Queen Kwenthrith to her throne, I think we must explore it.
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as \"W\"?
Let me help you please, Sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
\"W\" stands for Wigstan.
He has royal blood, as well as being one of the most powerful warlords in Mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the Ruling Council.
No. Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
(CHUKLES) My Lord, no one should ever trust Wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not! The only way forward, the only choice now, is for both of you noble kings to raise your armies and invade Mercia and rid my kingdom of all the factions who want to ruin me!
Me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.

Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.

Odo: Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
Rollo: You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
Odo: What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
Rollo: We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
Rollo: I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
(SIGHS) He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward (INHALES) kills a man by stabbing him in the back.

But you are no longer a Viking.

Charles: You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your Highness, forgive me, I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
Charles: You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should... Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
(BIRDS SHRIEKING IN DISTANCE)
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What... What are you saying?
(SHOUTING) Do... Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, (CHUCKLES) if at all, to his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Charles: For God's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Charles: Is it true?
Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition (STUTTERING) to replace me?
To become Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you, (STUTTERING) please, stay close, to Count Odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go! Leave me!

Is this how you looked?
Yes.

What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The Emperor Dezong, of the Tang Dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a... A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...with his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.

Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
Do you want to hear it?
Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.

So we are agreed, we'll raise an army and attack Mercia.

Travel safely, my Lord.
You are the best of allies.
Aelle: I'm a simple man at heart, but full of conviction.
Ecbert: Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties, say your prayers, and banish the Devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my Lord Aelle.
Farewell.
Kwenthrith: King Ecbert?
Man: Front King's Guard!
Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?
Man: All men forward!
Man: Move out!
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOOR CREAK OPEN)
Lord, you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel, to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
(WIND HOWLING)

I may find cause where others may not.

And we shall go together to Paris.

You must be excited to be going back.
(SOFTLY) No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it, I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.

It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki. Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki. Sit down. Make room.
Both of you join us.
Fill the horns.
Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
He's keen to know you.
All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?

Kneel.
Take this offering of earth and salt to remind you that you belong both to the earth and to the sea.
(SIGHS)
These arm rings symbolize your coming of age.
They also bind you in loyalty and fealty to me, your king and your father.
Any oath you swear upon these rings must be kept, or else you will sacrifice your honor and your place in Valhalla.
Do you understand?
Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.
Do you swear so?
Both: Yes, Father.
There!
Put on your rings, my brothers!
(ALL CHEERING)
Come here.
I'm taking the boys with me to Paris.
They're too young.
It is my decision, if they come or not, and they are not too young to watch.
In any case, they're safer with me than they were the last time with you, as I remember.

(CLEARS THROAT)
(SIGHS)
Family, nobles and friends, I have summoned you together because I have made an important decision.
(ALL MURMURING)
Alfred...
(PATS SEAT)
There we go.
I have decided to send my grandson, Prince Alfred, on a pilgrimage to Rome, so that he might see the holy city and meet His Holiness the Pope.
(ALL MURMURING)
This idea was given to me by Father Prudentius, who has himself visited the holy city and is willing to act as Prince Alfred's guide.
Now, some of you may ask, why send Alfred and not his older brother?
And my answer to you is this.
We all know the circumstances of Alfred's birth.
It was my belief then, and it is still my belief, that Alfred has been chosen by God for great things.
This journey will be a preparation for whatever great future our Lord has designed for him.
I wish, Father, that you had first discussed this matter with me.
The road to Rome is filled with untold dangers. The boy is still too young.
Yes, I am aware of the dangers, that is why I also wish you to accompany your son so that you may protect and comfort him.
(ALL MURMURING)
My son, so devout a man as yourself can hardly object to undertaking a pilgrimage to the very center of our faith, nor yet meeting in person the descendent of St. Peter.
No. But who will lead our armies against Mercia and place its rightful queen at her throne?
Oh, be not afraid of that. I personally will lead our armies in that venture.
(APPLAUSE)
How long would it take to walk to Rome?
Father...
(WHISPERS) Ask him again.
How long will it take?
Your Highness, we will walk for about 12 miles a day, and the whole journey is 1,100 miles.
It will be very tiring.
Only your feet will be tired, Your Highness, but at the end of the journey, your soul will be filled with joy and happiness.
Mmm.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(RAT SQUEAKING)
Shh!
Let me have the stash of my medicine.
You don't have to dole it out to me like I'm a child.
Hmm. But you are a child when it comes to this stuff, and someone needs to control what, apparently, you cannot.
Then how will I get it when I'm in Paris?
It's easy. Take me with you.
(MUMBLES)
I want to go.
I don't want to stay here.
You said I can do as I please, but you keep me here like one of your rats in a cage.
No.
(RATS SQUEAKING)
It's the only way you can get your medicine.
And you may need me for other things as well.
What other things?
I speak Frankish.
Can you?
Let me ask you a question.
I want to know the day that I will die.
You will die on the day that the blind man sees you.
Is that true?
Don't lie to me.
Whether or not you believe is up to you.
But in due course, we will both know if it is true or not.

We have. His Grace and I will now lead our forces to the two forts we have built downriver.
And from these forts, we will defend the city, if necessary, to the death.
We are ready for the heathen.
Your Grace, you are the difference between failure and triumph.
With your help, we can frustrate and defeat the enemy.
I beg and beseech you.
I actually would fall on my knees before you. Me, the Emperor.
The grandson of Charlemagne himself.
Yes.
I would beg you, for all we have given you, not to change sides.
Not to betray us.
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, for the sake of Paris, do not return to your brother.
I will not betray you.
I will not betray Paris.
And I will not betray my wife.

(SIGHS) Do you really believe that?
Is it really possible? Personally, I don't think so.
When Ragnar appears, when his brother appears, is it not likely that our Duke Rollo will embrace him?
Don't you think they might have already planned these things?
I thought you needed him to fight with you.
I was wrong.
He was useful to us early on.
I would've got rid of him subsequently.
You see, these are precisely the decisions an emperor must make if he wishes to keep his throne.

No, not tonight.
I will chain you up, just as you are.

Yes, but he won't be expecting us to attack by land also.
In unison with the boats, we'll send a party on foot to the nearest fort.
And they will engage the arches, diverting their attention away from the boats.
Yes?
I agree. The boats have more chance without the arches hindrance.
Any objections?
I'll lead that party by foot.
Man: Then it is agreed we attack tomorrow.
(MEN CHEERING)
At least, let ours be the first boat through.
Mmm.
(MEN CHEERING)
Erlendur.
This belongs to you, yes?
It is your father, King Horik's ring.
Mmm. No, you're mistaken.
I've never seen that ring before.
(CHUCKLES)
What happened?
He said it was not his ring.
He's lying.
I know it is his father's ring.
Forgive me for caring, but you shouldn't fight tomorrow.
(SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
Let me explain something to you.
A long time ago the Seer prophesized that I would never have another child.
If he's right, it doesn't matter what I do.
Well.
You're certainly doing everything in your power to prove the seer's prophecy right.
Father.
Can we fight with you tomorrow?
Please.
You're not strong enough yet, boys.
I want you to stay here.
I want you to protect all the food and the supplies.
Can you do that for me?
Yes, Father.
Yes?
Yes.
Good boys.
Keep your bows close.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

Hmm.

This is the man I knew only as W.
Who is really Prince Wigstan of the Mercian royal family.
Is that correct?
Yes, King Ecbert.
That is correct.
Interesting place for our meeting.
I believe it is.
For this is the mausoleum of the kings and queens of Mercia.
My family.
Those caskets contain the bones of my ancestors.
Many from the golden age of Mercia when our kingdom was powerful, proud and stood head and shoulders above any other kingdom on this island.
Many more contain the bones of those who have died in the frenzied bloodlettings of our recent past.
Here lie my father, brother, uncles, and my sons.
And here is my sainted mother.
She watched her grandsons butchered before her eyes before they blinded her, cut out her tongue, cut off her breasts, and burnt her while she was still alive.
And who did this?
My family.
The ruined, corrupt, decadent dregs of a once illustrious name.
And you shelter for your own purposes another of my mad descendants.
Kwenthrith, whose only claim to the throne rests in the murder of her own uncle and two of her own brothers.
I do not shelter her out of any love for her person, but because I thought she might be a stabilizing factor.
The last thing I needed was a chaotic neighbor.
If you ever supposed that Kwenthrith could play a calming, stabilizing role in this madhouse we call Mercia, then you are as mad as the rest of them.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
However, I doubt it.
I know your ambitions.
And to the point.
You proposed this meeting.
To what end?
Yes.
To the end.
Exactly.
The ruling council as they call themselves are a lot of fools, monkeys and drunkards.
Mostly distant relations.
I say a plague on them.
My proposal is simple.
I still have an army, of sorts.
We will join with the army you have brought and easily, believe me, overcome the council and their lickspits.
And then?
And then I mean to renounce this world.
I have seen enough of its ways.
They corrupted me, I know that.
But how is it possible not to be corrupted.
I also lost my faith in God.
I could no longer conceive that our Lord could sanction the death of everyone I loved.
But that is the road to despair.
And I wish before I die to take the road of hope.
Therefore, after we are victorious, I shall quit Mercia and England.
And travel in pilgrimage to Rome as a common beggar.
I only want a chance to redeem my sins.
And the kingdom?
Werferth, bring my mother's casket.
I shall formally renounce the kingdom in your name.
You will afterwards be king of Wessex and Mercia.
Your kingdom will be huge.
But in you I see a leader strong and ambitious enough to take both our countries forward and defend them against our enemies.
Especially the Northmen.
Open it.
This was once the ancestral crown of Mercia.
Now it will be your crown, King Ecbert.
(LOTHBROK BREATHING HEAVILY)

We bought into the magic of Ragnar Lothbrok.
We thought no one could stand in his way.
In our world, we cannot accept compromise.
We cannot accept failure.

If I were you, I wouldn't talk about Ragnar Lothbrok like that to my face.
(SIGHS)
You know this weakens you.
This weakens you in every way.
(BELL TOLLING)
Count Odo, I am forever in your debt.
The tribute should not all go to me, Your Highness, but to your warriors and soldiers who have surpassed themselves in courage, and proved themselves worthy successors to the armies of Charlemagne.
You are the savior of Paris.
Tell me, what can I give you as a reward?
It distresses me to say so, your Highness, but I fear the trust you have placed in the Northman Rollo is misplaced.
How so? Has he not guided us well?
Well, it's true he has contributed to the defeat of his brother.
But that was not for the sake of Paris.
It was a quarrel between them.
And now Rollo has the upper hand, I fear he may revert to his instincts.
Rollo's conversion to Christianity is a joke.
For there is nothing else in the mind of the pagan Rollo but the destruction of Paris and its Emperor.
You may be right.
Count Odo: I am right.
And Roland can confirm it.
I believe we can no more trust him than trust a wild boar.
In any case, Your Highness, he has now served his purpose.
Then?
Then you must use your power and proceed quickly.
Arrest Rollo before he can savor and celebrate his triumph.
Or before he escapes to raise an army against us.
But my daughter...
Will get over it.
She is young and can entertain the prospect of a more...
Civilized marriage.
I am grateful for your honesty, as well as your valor, Count Odo.
Let me reflect on this for a while.

Judith, have you any news of your husband or of Alfred?
No, Sire. There is no news.
We must hold a special mass to pray for them.
But I know the boy is safe.

At least we wouldn't go home empty-handed!
But they are not Paris.
We left Paris behind.
Maybe you have, but I haven't.
What do you mean?
What I say.
Nobody here understands what you're saying, King Ragnar.
Well, then maybe they ought to listen, instead of talking.
We are going to lift the boats up the cliff.
Then we are going to carry them across the mountains, past the forts, and then simply slide them back into the river. Upstream.
Haraldson: Carry them? Up there?
Yes.
Up there.
You can do that, can't you, Floki?
Or am I wrong?
No.
I can do it, Ragnar. I can do it for you.

Forgive me, I had to come and see you.
We have important matters to discuss between us.
Indeed.
You know, of course, that I am with child.
And who, pray, is the father?
Your son, Aethelwulf.
My son?
Yes.
After he rescued me, we formed an attachment.
A sincere attachment.
How strange life is.
Have you told Judith?
I have told no one but you.
I also need to return to Mercia, as her true queen, by your good graces.
You are no longer Queen of Mercia.
But if, if the council are all dead and Wigstan is gone then...
You are no longer the Queen, because I am the King.
You are the King of Mercia?
And of Wessex together. Yes.
Waerferth.
Before they were unfortunately put to death, the members of the Ruling Council, along with your family, were obliged to put their seals to these documents, whereby Lord Wigstan, in the presence of the laity and the clergy of Mercia, accepted both your abdication from the throne and my assumption of it.
What?
As you see, the devices are legal, the documents, binding.
Both in the eyes of men and of God.
No! You are a monster!
I always knew.
But, until this moment, I never realized how truly monstrous you are!
My own sins seem so trivial, so unimpressive!
How do you sleep at night, Lord Ecbert? How do you sleep?
(DOOR CLOSES)
Your Grace, I wish to commend you for everything you've done for me, and for Paris.
And for me.
I gave you my word. And I kept it.
Then I drink to you, and salute you, and thank God for you.
Amen!
The defeat of Ragnar Lothbrok will resound down the ages.
What defeat?
As long as my brother is still alive, he is not defeated.
He has retreated.
His chance to attack again has diminished.
And in the meantime, we can continue to build our defenses against him.
You talk as if you no longer need me to protect you.
I do not wish to give you that impression.
You should also know that I am carrying Rollo's child.

But still, since you returned to the city, you've made no effort to see me.
And, in the meantime, I have had an interesting idea.

Everything I do is holy.
That's why you called me back.
I heard you calling to me across empty oceans and vast deserts.
That is why I returned.
I try to live like the gods.
I reject everything of this world...
Honor and glory, love of oneself, even shame.
I only care about the will of the gods.
Only then can everything worldly pass away, can the voices of the gods be heard.
And then their spirit dwells in me, and I feel the ability to heal and prophecy.
And take on the sins of the world...
Upon myself.

I do not know if you are a god, (MOANS) but all I longed for was your presence, and your caresses.

Even had I wanted to reinstate...
But you didn't want to, did you?
You'd worked it out before with Waerferth.
Everything had been arranged.
Isn't that true?
It's true.
And I ask your forgiveness.
My forgiveness?
Yes.
Because I cannot ask for God's.
I know I'm already beyond that.
But if only you will understand.
Why me?
I love you.
I know you may treat this statement as compromised.
Disingenuous. Perhaps even as a lie. And why shouldn't you?
But the funny thing is...
It's true.
I have lied about many, many things, both to others and to myself.

You must understand that I cannot allow you to leave. Especially not with Magnus.
What difference does it make to you?
It makes every difference.
Magnus is the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
When Ragnar Lothbrok returns to this island, as well he might, I want to show him the son that I have cared for and protected.
You also carry my son's child.
Am I not entitled to show an interest in his future?
And besides, where on earth did you intend to go?
I intended to go as far away from you as possible.
That is not acceptable. You will stay here and be confined.
I will place guards around the villa. Do not expect to escape.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

You stay here. Get well.
I don't mind.
But don't die, Floki.
(SNIFFLING)
(PANTING)
Ah.
I'm leaving.
I need you to give me what you have left.
There's nothing left.
You're lying again.
Let me tell you...
The only reason that I wanted you to come was because of the medicine.
I am here because you said I was a free woman.
I never said that you were free.
I said that you could come and go as you please.
You're a liar.
You've lied to me and you've lied to your people.
But you made the mistake of telling me your secret about the slaughter of the families in Wessex.

Papal secretary: Welcome.
God bless you all for undertaking the arduous journey here to meet His Holiness.
Holy Father, let me present to you Prince Alfred and Prince Aethelwulf of Wessex, and our old friend, Father Prudentius.
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)
Let me speak first to both of you.
Holy Father.
Holy Father.
Like a good shepherd caring for his sheep, we care very much for our flock in England.
Like us, you are assailed by pagan armies who love only destruction and death.
If Christian people do not quickly do penance for their various vices and crimes, then a great and crushing disaster will swiftly come upon you.
I fear that is true, Holiness.
We already see what has happened in England and now in Frankia.
But we look to the future, to you, Prince Alfred of Wessex.
Step forward, my son.
I have something amazing to show you.
Here in Rome, we have many treasures.
And here is almost the greatest of them.
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)
Do you know what this is?
When our Lord was taken to the place of crucifixion, what did the pagans make him carry?
His own cross.
And what did they place upon his head?
A crown of thorns.
This is one of the very thorns that cut our Savior's head.
(HORN BLOWING)
(VIKINGS CHANTING IN DISTANCE)
The farmer was a generous man.
Yes, with all his goods and chattels!
We enjoyed their company.
Did you kill them?
Of course we killed them.
They could have ridden off and told the Franks all about us.
You would have done the same.
I'm not blaming you.

(SCREAMS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
It's Lagertha. You had better come...
Both of you.
I lost my child.
I knew that I could never have the child, no matter what I did.
The Seer told me a long time ago but I was hoping that I could cheat the fates.
Shh.
It's all right.
(SOBBING)
Shh.
Shh.
Go away.
Shh.
Just, just go away!
Leave me alone.
Your Highness.
Your Grace. Daughter.
How grateful I am that we can now announce that you are with child.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
The alliance between our peoples, born of baptism and marriage, is the only way to safeguard our future.
In the meantime, what efforts has Your Grace made to ensure that the pagans have quit our realm?
I have sent boats down river to ascertain the truth of it.
It may well be that my brother will choose to sack and plunder Rouen, rather than return to his people empty-handed.
But I have already sent word to the lords of that town to prepare their defenses against such an attack.
Above all men, I know how much I owe both to God, and to those closest to me, for our delivery from evil.
Now, I would also like to express the same to Sire Roland.
Though an underling, I believe you did far more than Count Odo to preserve and defend our city.
Therefore, I proclaim you in turn, Count Roland, Defender of Paris.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
And may you continue to serve us faithfully as before.
I am honored and humbled.
And ready to sacrifice myself at any moment for Your Highness's greater glory.
You may all leave, content in my good graces.
Except for you, Count Roland.
Stay a moment.
I want to ask your permission, Count Roland.
My permission?
But for what?
Why should the Emperor ever have to ask permission?
I want to sleep with your sister.
I desire her to be my mistress.
Have you asked her?
I would like your permission...
...first.
You have it.
Of course, Your Highness.
I am sure she will think of herself as the most fortunate woman in Paris.
Wait.
There is something else.
Why is my father giving preference to those people?
I don't know.
I don't think you understand the way things work here.
You are too simple.
Simple?
What is simple?
The person who is closest to my father is the person who has the most power in Frankia.
And it seems as if he has suddenly given power to a young soldier.
But I am Duke.
I have been given great lands, and the responsibility for the defense of the entire realm.
Even as you say those words, they start to sound hollow.
Entire realm, great lands.
What does it mean?
Roland has actually been given command of the city.
He will always be closest to the Emperor.
Do not underestimate your father.
Oh, it would be impossible to underestimate him.
Just as it would be impossible to understand him.
It's not right that a man of such humble origin should take precedence over you, or me!
It's unfortunate, but this Roland should be removed before his appetite for power becomes too pronounced.
Hmm.
What are you doing?
Hmm?
I'm trying to have s*x.
I am with child.
So?
You are carrying my child!
This makes me very happy.
So, it's not possible.
No, it's really quite...
Simple.
It's not going to happen.
(GROANS)
I told you, this is Frankia, we do things differently here. You have to respect me in my sacred condition.
(EXHALES)
Many things are better here.
Just a few things which were better before.

I suppose you should be congratulated, King Ecbert.
By a clever ruse you have become ruler of one of the biggest, richest kingdoms in England.
And all without my help.
Despite the fact that we are formally allies.
No, fortunately, there was limited bloodshed.
Which is always to be favored.
After all, we need our armies to fight not each other, but the Northmen.
You always have a clever answer.
The fact is, you betrayed me!
You told me nothing of your plans.
We were to divide Mercia equally between us.
But you have taken it all.
And now it occurs to me your new kingdom directly abuts mine.
So it does.
But surely we are still allies?
I feel I ought to ask you that question.
It may be true that things have changed.
Life is all about change, is it not, King Aelle?
If we don't change, we fall behind.
What was once true, and real, is suddenly no longer true, no longer real.
And sometimes, we have to accept that.
You mean our alliance?
Yes.
We had an alliance as equals.
But, as you can plainly see, we are no longer equals.
Everything has changed.
For both of us.
You must get used to it.

You didn't ask for anything in return.
What do you want?
What can I give you?
Perhaps you could have asked me that question a long time ago.
When I first met you, I saw something in you.
You still have it.
It's a refusal to abide by the rules.
A wildness, only just contained.
I still love that about you.
Do you?
I do.
I chose you as my companion.
I accept that you might not love me.
I know that my being the son of Ragnar Lothbrok has little meaning to you.
And I like that about you.

And I will have my revenge.

It always seems to me like yesterday.
And how perfect to punish Ragnar by killing his son.

Today is the day!
You have to kill him.
No.
Yes. It's decided.
The gods want you to do it, not me.
I've dedicated this sacrificial offering to them.
Now you must drink.

What if I won't do it?

I told you, you have no choice.
If you have any feelings for your son or care whether he lives or dies.

I'm listening.
I went on a raiding party last year to England, with Earl Gunnar Asgrimsson.
We fought against the armies of King Ecbert, and wintered in Wessex.
And made a treaty with Ecbert's ealdormen.
And they told us that your father, King Ragnar, had sired a child there by Queen Kwenthrith of Mercia, and that this child still lives at Ecbert's court.
What's the child's name?
Magnus.
He is a young man now, 12 years old.
And you are certain that this Magnus is really my father's child?
How can I be certain?
I was not there at the conception.
Why would they lie?
There was something else you learned from Ecbert's ealdormen, was there not?
Well?
It was about your father's farming settlement in Wessex.
We asked if it still existed and they laughed, and said it was destroyed almost as soon as your father sailed away.
But that they allowed some of the settlers to escape, so they would take the word to your father, as a warning.
He never mentioned it.
Ask him now.
We don't know where Ragnar is.
He left soon after his defeat in Paris.
We haven't seen him in years.
Forgive me asking, but how can such a man just disappear?
(SCOFFS)
(BJORN SIGHS)
Aslaug: Go and eat and drink after your long journey, Thorhall.
We are grateful for your visit.
I have to tell the boys. Where are they?
They went up to the cabin to hunt.
(SIGHS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Ubbe: Ivar. Wake up.
(GASPS)
Bjorn is here.
Ubbe: You think our father never knew?
Bjorn: It's possible.
In those early days, it wasn't easy to navigate the sea.
He knew.
He had to.
If he did, he should have told the people.
Everyone lost relatives.
Fathers and uncles, sons and daughters.
They would have demanded revenge.
That is why he didn't tell them.
What do you mean?
It was a waste of time.
They were dead!
Ragnar wanted to sail to Paris.
He wanted to be famous.
Isn't that more important?
Hmm?
You could say that?
I can say that?
What does that mean?
Here's what it means, at least to me.
Our father abandoned us.
We were just kids and he ran off.
Only the gods know if he's still alive.
And now we hear he kept this big secret from everyone.
That he was not truthful or honest.
It makes me feel sick.
How could our father not tell the people what had happened?
Maybe if he'd told them, they would have killed him.
If it's true...
If it's true that our father lied to his people, and abandoned them, then I hope he never comes back.
He betrayed our name.
Hvitserk: If he ever came back, I would kill him.
(SIGHS)
Me too.
Screw you!
(CHUCKLES)
All of you.
He never did anything wrong.
He is our father.
And that is the end of it.
You all sound like a bunch of Christians.
I love our father as much as you do.
Who said I loved him, Ubbe?
I said I admired him.
He's Viking.
And you are soft.
I am not soft!
None of us is soft.
But we want to understand what our father did.
And what he was.
As his son, his fame does not interest me.
What he used his power for, now that would interest me.
(SCOFFS)
By now, my brothers, there will be a lot of anger in Kattegat.
Now they know the truth.
Our father betrayed a whole generation of people.
So if he ever came back... -I don't think he is ever going to come back.
I think what happened in Paris finally broke him.
You can all say whatever you want, but he was a human.
People started to talk as if he was a god.
He was not a god, he was a man!
A man with many dreams and many failings.
I've learned that in the years since he went away.
If I was him, I wouldn't come back.
Despite all his failings, he's still the greatest man in the world to me.
Did you know Ragnar lied to us all?
The settlement in Wessex was destroyed as soon as we left.
I know.
A farmer who escaped the slaughter told your father and I what had happened.
Ragnar killed him so no one else would find out.
You're a good friend to my father.
Helga: Hello, Bjorn.
Helga.
I was just coming to see how the boats were progressing.
Floki: What do you say, Helga?
What shall we tell him?
We think that it won't be long until you have boats ready and able to take you to the Mediterranean Sea!
(SCOFFS) If it exists.
Of course it exists.
Floki: It's just a map, Bjorn.
Marks on a paper. A child could have drawn it.
How can we know it's real?
I learned from my father.
The only way to tell if something is real...
...is to sail there.
I hope you'll come with me, Floki.
Are you joking?
The lure of an imaginary land.
Traveling somewhere that doesn't exist.
Of course I'm coming. (LAUGHS)
And I hope you'll come too, Helga.
Well, if Floki is mad enough to go, then I guess I will follow.

You've obviously all made your mind up about me.
I cannot blame you for that.
(SIGHS) So.
Well, boys, who is going to do it, then?
Who's going to kill me?
Well, I don't mind.
Go ahead.
Please.
What about you, Hvitserk?
You think you're a man now?
I dare you.
Put me out of my misery.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it, do it. (SHOUTS) Do it!
(CROWD GASPS)
Look at these people!
They no longer support me!
Look!
Why would they?
I am your leader, and I just left!
What kind of leader does that, huh?
(SHOUTING) What kind of king abandons his people?
What kind of father abandons his sons?
So, who wants to be king?
(SHOUTS) Oh, you know how this works!
If you want to be king, you must kill me.

Ah, who told you that?
A warrior who was fighting in Wessex.
And he was the one who told you about the settlement.
I came back...
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
I came back because I wanted to see what has become of my sons.
(BIRD CHIRPING)

And?
And I'm going to England.
And I thought that you all might want to join me.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
What do you say, Hvitserk?
Ubbe?
No.
Sigurd?
I can see in your eyes that your answer is also no, Bjorn.
This is why.
This is part of a map of the Roman Empire.
I found it in Paris.
In this map is the Mediterranean Sea.
And around that sea are many wonderful people and places and towns.
I want to go there!
(EXHALES)
So...
How far along are you with your plans?
Floki is building the boats.
Hvitserk has agreed to come with me as well as King Harald and his brother.
What about you two?
Why are you not going with your brother?
Kattegat has changed since you went away.
It is a major trading center in the region.
And many other kings we know regard it with envy.
We want to stay and protect our mother.
(LOW RHYTHMICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Your father's return brings calamity, disorder, chaos, tragedy and death.
For all their glories, the gods will be filled with despair.
(SEER BREATHING RASPILY)

Go away, Bjorn Ironside.
(SIGHS) Then tell me this.

Ah.

I'm going to raid England again.

Why do you want to raid England again?
I've heard your son Bjorn has other plans.
Yes, he does, but I have my own plans.
To exact revenge on the destruction of the settlement.
Yeah. My brother and his family went with you.
They were farmers, like me.
We never did find out what happened to them.
But it seems you knew all along and didn't tell us.
And now you want us to go and revenge, not for my brother and his wife and their children, because you didn't care for them...
No...
For your own guilt.
And do you know what, Ragnar Lothbrok?
Do you know what?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Thank you for your time.
And if I had the mind to raid...
I would raid with your son, and not with you!
For I believe the gods have deserted you, King Ragnar Lothbrok!
You are on your own!
Everyone hates you now!
Lothbrok: You will have to travel down here, along the coast of Frankia.
It will be hard not to be detected.
I am sure Floki's new boats can outsail anything the Franks put out to sea.
We cannot be at sea forever.
Rollo has a new kingdom on the coast.
I don't see any other way.
Because there isn't one.
I could talk to Rollo.
Talk to him?
After what he did?
I have to be practical.
It is the best way.
It is our way.
I will send messengers to him and if he kills them, I will know where he stands.
And he will know where you are.
He would find out anyway.
I wish you were coming with me.
No, you don't.
You said yourself, this is your destiny, not mine.

I'm not sure I believe you, little brother.
And I'm sure you're jealous.
You cannot keep a slave to yourself.
No, not like that.
Mother, tell them to stop tormenting me.
It makes me so happy you are with a woman.
The rest of you should already be married.
Ubbe, you should have children.
I probably already have.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Just because you are the sons of a king does not mean you can be irresponsible.
It's important to find a woman and settle down.
I thought I had found a woman.
But now Ivar has taken her away from me.
Skol!
I don't mean love.
You don't have to love the woman.
As a king's son, you can have as many women as you like...
Both: Yeah! (CHUCKLING)
But you need one to breed with.
So then you don't believe in love?
Aslaug: I didn't say that.
So you loved Ragnar when you married him?
And he loved you?
Of course I loved him!
Some say that you bewitched him.
What is wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me.
I just want to know if she's ever loved anyone except Harbard.
You remember Harbard, don't you?
Ivar: Of course she has loved someone else.
She has always loved...
Me?
Isn't that right, Mother?
She feels pity for you.
That's all.
We all feel pity for you.
But sometimes we wish that she'd left you to the wolves.
Sigurd!
What?
(IVAR GROANING)
Ivar.
It is all right.
Are you coming over here?
Go on, Boneless.
(THUMP)
(SPOONS CLATTERING)
(IVAR GRUNTING AND PANTING)
Go on, little Ivar.
(GRUNTS)
What are you going to do?
(GROANING IN PAIN)
Stop! Stop!
(YELLING)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(HORN BLOWING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Man: It's good to be in Kattegat.
Man 2: Yeah, it'll be good.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
He's not scared of him.
No.
I'm telling you, he was afraid.
(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
Mother!
And Astrid.
What has brought you to Kattegat?
I have to watch my son depart for his destiny.
How could I stay away?
(CHUCKLING)
Welcome to the feast.
Thank you, Bjorn.
Halfdan. King Harald.
Bjorn Ironside. It's been a long time.
Come.
You have not been idle.
We have all heard of your exploits.
Harald: Yes.
That you captured Rogaland and overthrew King Arnarson and Earl Eyjolf.
Yes.
Bjorn: Hmm.
And also King Svein.
Hmm.
Then you are nearer to your ultimate ambition.
Of being King of Norway.
(CHUCKLING)
I think it is impossible, Bjorn.
How can I ever overthrow King Ragnar?
As for you, Bjorn, I want to say we believe in you.
We believe in this journey.
And we believe that the gods are with you.
Indeed.
Torvi: Astrid!
Come, have a drink.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Come meet my brothers.
Ah!
Ubbe, Hvitserk, Sigurd and Ivar.
Hvitserk is coming with us.
Harald: I remember you, I remember all of you!
But how you've all grown tall. You're not boys anymore!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I am so much taller when I stand up.
I'm sure you wish you could come with us.
Go to Hell.
(LAUGHING) I like him.

Floki!
Floki!
Harald.
Floki!
Good to see you.
So good to see you.
Come, come see Helga!
Helga!
We were wondering if you survived.
Yes, Helga.
(LAUGHTER)
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
Queen Aslaug.
Earl Ingstad.
Whatever our differences, it seems that my son Bjorn and your son Hvitserk will go on this journey together.
And so, we must wish them both the luck of the gods.
Perhaps we should make a sacrifice.
We should.
And we can both officiate.
You forget, Lagertha, I am the queen.
I never forget anything.
(SOFTLY) ...comes along, and it flows.
Harald: A toast!
To all of us!
Reunited and stronger than ever!
Skol!
All: Skol!
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Did he see you?
No.
Did he see you leaving?
No, no. But why?
He's crazy.
He wanted to kill me.
I am frightened of him.
Shh.
Ivar? He's just a cripple.
What do you mean, just a cripple?
He's the strongest, most violent man I have ever known.
And I want to be protected from him.
Why did he want to kill you?
(SIGHING)
In case I told you.
Told me what?
Told me what? You can tell me.
That he cannot satisfy a woman.
You won't say anything, will you, Sigurd?
I won't tell anyone.
Do you swear?
I won't tell anyone.
If he found out...
I won't tell anyone.
All right?
Thank you.
Poor Ivar.
Yeah.
Poor Margrethe.
I suppose you had to console her.
I did what I could.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Huh.
She's terrified of him.
So am I, Sigurd.
So am I.
(MEN SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(MEN CHANTING)
I know you can hear me.
I want you to know...
That I can never forgive you for taking away my husband and my world.
And look what you've done with it!
(DRUM BEATING)
You call yourself queen.
But you will never be queen in Kattegat.
(WIND WHISTLING)
What are you digging your horde up for?
Huh?
Everything you saved to spend after your death.
I have no choice!
I have to bribe people to sail with me.
You're a loser.
Why don't you come and help me lift, cripple boy?
Good boy.
(BOTH GRUNTING)

Inge: I'm coming!

I will.
Don't come back unless you have seen or done something extraordinary.
Otherwise, you will not be in the stories and what will I be able to tell our children about their famous father, Bjorn Ironside?
Tell them that...
I love them.

Oh, that's a good choice, I got that from Lindisfarne.
Go on, go on. Here you go.
Here. Hey.
Ubbe: What are you doing, Father?
What does it look like?
It looks like you're humiliating yourself.
Here you go.
You give me that.
No.
I don't care.
What if we care, Father?
Go on.
Ah, friend.
Have you changed your mind?
Perhaps.
For that I will sail with you.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
No, Father!
Take it.
Take it.
Thank you.
Take it!
(CROWD GASPING)
Take it!
Take it!
(CROWD CHEERING)
What are you doing?
I am going with Father.
What do you mean?
I am sailing to England.
Tell your father I need to speak to him.
He can't avoid me any longer.
My wife.
And mother of my sons.
We both know...
That love was not what brought us together.
But you've endured me.
You've suffered my words and my neglect.
(EXHALES)
Yet you never turned our sons against me.
I am sure that there are times when you've hated me...
But you never poisoned their minds...
Or stopped them from loving me.
And for all of that...
With all my heart, I am grateful to you.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Why are you saying this now?
Because it needed to be said.
(DOOR OPENING)

No, I didn't. I swear.

Just let me lie here beside you...
And touch you.

Ivar: Mother.
(SIGHS)
You can't go.
What are you talking about?
There's going to be a storm.
Everything will end in disaster.
(SIGHS)
You've seen that?
Yes, I've seen it.
You will drown.
I've seen it.
You can't go.
Stop telling me what to do, Mother.
Mother, all my life you have been suffocating me.
Paying me so much special attention.
Why?
Why Ivar?
Because I'm a cripple.
Poor Ivar.
But now poor Ivar has a chance to finally to prove himself for the gods.
I will not let you take that away from me, Mother.
You will die, Ivar.
I don't care if I die.
(FAINT CHUCKLE)
Mother...
I love you.
But...
Just one day with my father...
Being a man...
That's worth a lifetime of pity.

							Lothbrok: <i>Previously on</i> Vikings...
I'm going to raid England again, to exact revenge on the destruction of the settlement.
If I had the mind to raid, I would raid with your son.
This is part of a map of the Roman Empire.
I want to go there!
You will have to travel down here, along the coast of Frankia.
Rollo has a new kingdom on the coast.
I could talk to Rollo.
After what he did?
To all of us! Reunited! Stronger than ever! Skol!
All: Skol!
I can never forgive you for taking away my husband and my world.
You will never be queen of Kattegat.
I'm sailing to England. I'm going with Father.
You can't go. You will die!
One day with my father is worth a lifetime of pity.

Lothbrok: What weapons do we have?
So, Father, what are we going to do?
Your son asks a good question.
Here we are in deep trouble.
So what are you going to do about it?
(Exhales) I don't know yet.
Then you'd better make up your mind.
Because all this is your fault.
You made us sail here, and as far as we know, we...
This little group here, are all that are left.
Where is your army of revenge now, Ragnar Lothbrok?
I'll tell you where it is.
At the bottom of the sea, feeding the fishes.
(Grunting)
(Horses approaching)
Get down!
(Saxon captain calling out)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Ivar grunts)
Let's go.
Forget that thing. Just crawl.
(Gasping)
With this, I can walk like a normal man.
(Grunting)
Get off me!
I'm not going to stand around all day watching you try to be normal, when you never will be.
(Shouting) I am normal!
(Grunts)
(Gasping)
No, you are not.
Once you realize that, that is when greatness will happen.
Now crawl!

Are you going to try and contact Uncle Rollo?

Hmm!
This disaster, they all blame you for it.

Ah, it's just the great Ragnar Lothbrok, acting like a nurse to a cripple.

Soldier: What now, Prince Aethelwulf?
(Soldier calling out)
We find Ragnar Lothbrok.
(Indistinct conversations)
See how well treachery pays off, Bjorn.
Bjorn: Don't do anything stupid, Floki.
I've never done anything stupid in my life.
But I am contemplating whether dying would be better than dealing with this scum.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
I don't want to apologize.
What would be the point? We are where we are.
(Scoffs)
The gods have spoken.
This is my wife, Princess Gisla, and our children William, Marcellus, Celsa.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
My wife wants to know why you are here.
So do I.
(Spears clattering)
(Speaking Old Frankish)
(Exhales)
I want to go here.
To this sea.
But I have to sail along your coastline to get there.
I need safe passage for my fleet.
In return for what?
In return for not attacking your villages and towns, like we should do.
May I take this?
No.
(Spears clattering)
(Orders in Old Frankish)
(Blade swishing)
(Floki chuckles)
(Speaking Old Frankish)
How long do you think you can keep us prisoners, traitor?
We have 60 ships outside your ports full of Vikings!
Don't you think they will come knocking soon, if we don't return?
(Panting)
If we stick to the coast, we can, uh, find the fishing village.
We can make camp, and steal a boat in the morning.
That is what you want to do, isn't it?
What else is there for us?
It's the only thing we can do.
Aye.
(Girl singing in Old Saxon)

Those soldiers will have discovered the wreckage by now.
They'll be looking for us.
And if they find us, we look like part of a raiding party.
A small threat, but still a threat.
I have no doubt what they'll do to us.
You think it's possible we might be able to steal a boat?
I didn't come here to go back.
That is why we can no longer travel with our friends.
What... What are you talking about?
It can only be you... and me.
You and me?
You mean, an old man and a cripple?
Yes.
(All grunting)

Lagertha: <i>I am taking Kattegat back.</i>
Aslaug isn't fit to be queen.
What about Ragnar's sons?
Born of a witch.
They are still his sons.
Bjorn, Hvitserk, and Ivar are all gone.
But Ubbe and Sigurd remain.
Are you going to kill them, too?

Because... You can have this.
(Blade swishes)
(Gurgling)
(Grunts)
(Thuds)
(Breathing heavily)
(Breathing heavily)
Who is this?
A slave girl, Margrethe.
And why have you brought her?
She was being used by the sons of Ragnar.
All of them?
Did you hate all of the sons?
No.
But I thought Ivar would kill me.
But Ivar's gone.
Enough questions. I have to talk to Torvi.
How is Guthrum? How is your son?
He is happy and well.
You must return to Kattegat before your absence is noticed, but...
When you return, there is something else I need you to do.
(Sighs)
(Wind howling)
(Chains rattling)
(Creaking)
This is an interesting place you've brought us to.
I hope it's not the last place on Earth I see.
Why aren't you talking?
Could it be because you know you made a bad judgment?
We totally believed in you, and thought the gods did also.
Still, you must have a plan for getting us out of this mess.
And I'm sure we'd all like to hear what it is.
(Shouts) How could you ever think you can do business with Rollo?
He's killed hundreds of our people!
He's lied and cheated, double-crossed his own brother, renounced the gods, committed every crime known to man.
We should have attacked his fleet!
At least we could have fought and died like Vikings, instead of sheep.
(Door clangs open)
(Chains rattling)
(Speaking Old Frankish)
(Shackles clanging)
Do not disappoint us, Ironside.
(Door slams shut)
So, Ragnar has returned.
Aethelwulf: He came with a fleet, but his ships were broken up in a storm.
It seems unlikely many of them survived.
But some survivors were found slaughtered near the village of Wareham.
Who killed them?
Well, I don't know. But we didn't.
And there is no sign of Ragnar?
No.
You'll keep searching.
In the meantime, I must leave for council in Repton.
I cannot ignore my duties just because one man has illegally entered my kingdom.
He is not just one man!
He is the history of his race, Father.
He is the face of the enemy we must always fight, always overcome.
And if we are the lambs of God, then he...
(Bangs table)
He is the eternal wolf.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
You didn't.
(Footsteps approaching)
What's this?
It's the raven banner of Ragnar Lothbrok.
We think he's returned to haunt us.
Will he come here?
Who knows?
But as long as he does not arrive at the head of 3,000 warriors, I refuse to be alarmed, whatever my son says.
He is, after all... just a man.
How do we know that we're going in the right direction, Father?
All roads lead to the throne.
(Laughs) Sounds good, but it's probably wrong.
(Panting)
(Captain speaking Old Saxon)
(Thud)
(Ivar grunts in pain)
(Horses neighing)
(Relieved sighs)
(Ivar exhales)
(Lothbrok groans)
(Ivar grunts)
(Breathing heavily)
I bet you wish you'd never brought me along. Right?
And I bet you wish you would have killed me when I was born, just like you wanted to.
Only when you talk.
I thought your legs were a weakness and you wouldn't survive.
I was wrong.
Your legs have given you a strength, a strength that even your brothers don't have.
You are like a deaf man whose eyesight is sharper than anyone else.
You are special, not in spite of your legs, but because of them.
I think that's the first time you've ever admitted to being wrong.
It'll never happen again, so enjoy it.
Bjorn, let me present to you Johannes Scotus Erivgena, a librarian.
I sent for him from Paris.
Hence the delay. Come.
I want Scotus to explain this map to you.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
That sight you see on the table in front of you is the Strabo map of the entire road network of the Roman Empire at its zenith.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
Of which your own map is but a mere fragment.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
You can see that the Empire was all built around the Mediterranean Sea.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
It started here in Rome, then it annexed all of these Greek territories, and then went here, into what is now known as Saracen, Spain.
(Speaking Old Frankish)
Which is to say, \"a Muslim Caliphate.\"
(Inhaling deeply)
So, to reach the enclosed sea...
You will have to navigate some dangerous waters, and into the Bay of Biscay, here, which is also notorious for its storms and its violent seas.
But first, we must sail along the Frankish coast.
Is there any other route?
Can you...
(Speaking in Old Frankish)
Ah! No.
No other route.
Will you give us safe passage along the Frankish coast, so we may sail unmolested?
No.
(Scoffs)
Only if you allow me to come with you.
(Lothbrok panting)
(Ivar clicks tongue)
(Chuckles) Come on, donkey.
(Exhales)
What if we're walking in the wrong direction, hmm?
Then we'll turn around and walk the other way.
(Imitates donkey bray)
(Panting)
What is it about you?
What?
Well, you do not seem to accept the verdict of the gods.
What is their verdict? You tell me.
If you want to know if the gods still favor you, then look around.
Look at us.
(Panting) You give the gods too much credit.
Oh, so then you disagree with all of us?
With the Seer, with everyone?
What if I do? Huh?
Well, I guess that is why you are who you are.
(Panting)
I never thought of that before.
You were just my famous father.
I thought you must have got lucky because the gods chose you, but...
Maybe that is not true.
(Panting)
But you are not Viking. You renounced your heritage!
You embraced our world and our god, and I have had your children.
And they are not Viking.
And if I thought they were Viking, I would kill them before killing myself.
(Inhales sharply)
Everything you say is true.
But I love you and I love my children.
But I cannot deny that part of myself which is still Viking, no matter how hard I try.
Then perhaps you don't try hard enough.
When you... When you hear thunder, it's only thunder.
But for me, it is still Thor beating his hammer.
(Sighs)
(Grunts)
(Glass shatters)
If you go away, whether you live or die, this will probably be the end of us.
(Footsteps retreating)
Come on, brother.
Let's go.
(Horse neighs)
Yah!
Two sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.
How privileged we are.
If you say so.
How many of you are there altogether?
Who can say for sure?
(Chuckles)
I know of one for sure.
Ubbe: Yes.
And may the gods be with Bjorn and our brother Hvitserk, wherever they may be. Hmm.
Skol!
Skol.
Skol.
Skol.
But you are here, and so is Margrethe.
So we were told. We're not quite sure why.
Margrethe has invited you here because she loves both of you.
You will have to decide amongst yourselves.
Unless...
You decide that you can share her.
(Moaning)

Once we get inside, we will be separated.
If you are smart, you will not be hurt.
When I can, I will find you.
I know what to do.
I think you brought me here for a reason.
No matter what they do to me, you have to act like a cripple, and then they won't feel threatened by you.
And what are they going to do to you?
(Sighs) So I'm... I'm going to watch you being hurt?
Sounds like a good plan.

(CHEERING DIES DOWN)
Aslaug: How strange, Lagertha, that you should play the usurper.
One woman against another.
It doesn't quite fit with your reputation.
Lagertha: I was never the usurper.
Always the usurped.
You took my husband, my world, and my happiness.
The fact that you're a woman is neither here nor there.
I didn't take your husband. He chose to be with me.
He didn't choose.
You're a witch.
You bewitched him.
If that's what you want to believe, it's up to you.
I don't disagree women can have power over men.
But it's not always magical, is it, Lagertha?
In any case, Ragnar is dead.
(VILLAGERS MURMURING)
You don't know that.
I dreamed it.
I warned him about his journey.
In my dream, his boats were sunk in a storm.
Ragnar died.
So did my son, Ivar.
But you don't know that.
No.
I don't know that for sure.
It was just a dream.
And I have dreamed of taking back my home.
I have dreamed it for a long time.
But if I have to fight for it, then I will.
Don't worry. I could never fight you, Lagertha.
I am not my mother, nor yet my father.
I would never win.
(SWORD CLATTERS)
(VILLAGERS MURMURING)
But still I have fulfilled my destiny.
The gods foretold Ragnar would have many sons.
And I have given him those sons.
I am as much a part of his saga, Lagertha, as you are.
But now I renounce everything.
(VILLAGERS MURMURING)
All I ask is safe passage.
All I ask is that you let me leave here in peace, to go wherever the gods decide.
And you shall have back your hearth and home...
With my blessing.
And my sons, when they hear how it was done, will be grateful for the manner of it...
And not seek revenge.
I understand.
Thank you.

My son and I have come to see a good friend, King Ecbert.

Ecbert: What did he say?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
He said thank you.
Hmm.
It was wrong of my son to slaughter all your farmers and their families.
But as you probably guessed, it was done under my orders.
It's always better to get the worst things over straight away, don't you agree?
Mea culpa. Mea maxima culpa.
It was my decision.
Of course, it was part of a larger and bolder strategy.
But...
(SLURPING)
Well, none of that's of your concern.
(SIGHS)
(BANGS)
On your previous visit...
You left behind another son.
Fetch Magnus.
Unfortunately, his mother, Queen Kwenthrith, is no longer with us.
But I've looked after the boy as if he were my own.
Come forward, boy.
Come, come.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
This is your son, Magnus.
(SIGHS)
Go on, Magnus. Speak to your father.
I have waited a very long time for this moment.
My mother told me so much about you.
She told me I was like you, and that one day I'd be famous like you.
And now I see you, everything she told me was true.
Everything about my life makes sense now.
Someone once explained to me what a miracle is.
So now I understand, Magnus.
Your birth was a miracle.
A miracle?
Yes.
(SIGHS)
Because I never had s*x with your mother.
All she ever did was piss on me.
Perhaps you should leave us, Magnus.
Talk to him later, eh?
You know, I had my doubts about that boy all along.
(CHAINS RATTLING)
Why have you taken so long to return?
It was part of a larger...
And bolder strategy.
(LAUGHING)
(STOMPS FOOT)
Where's our mother?
Lagertha: She's dead, Ubbe.
I killed her.
Why?
She took Kattegat away from me.
I wanted it back.
(SWORDS UNSHEATHING)
Why didn't you also have us killed?
This was nothing to do with you.
You are Ragnar's sons.
It was not your fault that your father was bewitched.
It was a mistake not to kill us.
That's a chance I was prepared to take.

(CHOKES)
What would you do if I let you out?
(EXHALES)
I would kill you.
Oh.
Or not.
It is your decision, not mine.
Mmm? You have the power, not me.
Hmm.
And you like power, don't you?
Well, I only like it because it allows me to do good things.
Really?
(SLURPING)
(CHAIN RATTLES)
(THUDS)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I think I've used my power rather well.
For example, I've used it to unite all the small, squabbling kingdoms of England into a single entity, now capable of defending itself against any who might come to threaten or destroy it.
Like me.
I thought you came in search of good farming lands and that you wanted to find some way that our peoples could live together and mutually benefit.
Oh, so you thought by killing all of my people, that was mutually beneficial, hmm?
No, no.
Of course not.
I've already expressed my deep regret.
The fact is...
It was the right idea at the wrong time.
But I firmly and I absolutely believe that such accommodations will come to pass.
Perhaps even in my grandson's time.
In Alfred's time.
What do you want me to say?
The truth.
Let's go and do it now.
Let's go to the Great Hall and let's finish her off.
If you want to do it, then do it.
But count me out.
What are you talking about?
She wouldn't have done it for us.
What?
Try to understand. She didn't want us.
She never loved us. She only loved Ivar.
Oh, yeah and Harbard.
Yes, she loved Harbard all right.
She made a fool of herself loving him.
You should have seen her!
Ah, you forget I did see.
Do you think Harbard was a god?
Was he a god, Ubbe? Or just a man?
He took advantage.
I guess that doesn't matter either way.
She was still our mother! (INHALES DEEPLY)
By the end she was a stranger to me.
Was she a witch?
(SIGHS) We'll never know.
Ah, well...
Lagertha must pay the price. (GROANS)
Let Ivar kill her if he wants to.
If he's still alive.
What?
Both our parents may be dead.
We may have just become orphans, Sigurd.
(LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at?
Our father isn't dead, Ubbe.
Ragnar Lothbrok can't die.
(SLAMS TABLE)

For the people outside of this villa, and for most of them inside of it, too, for that matter, you are the most dangerous man on this earth.

The seer told me that I am fated to die the day the blind man sees me.
(EXHALES)
But you...
You have to kill me.
Must we talk of death?
Death has been uppermost on my mind for a long time.
You Vikings are incorrigible.
You emerge from the womb with only one thing on your mind...
How to die!
(CONTINUES GROANING)

Are you talking about women?

And become a man.
But I don't want to leave.
You have no choice.
Here's some food for your journey.
Captain: (YELLING) Double up the watch there!
Where shall I go?
Destiny will take you.
And wherever you go, you tell people that you are Magnus, the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
And people will look after you.
You can't make me go! Please!
I'm happy. I won't go!
Start walking.
(GRUNTS)
You start walking or you're going to die. Do you understand?
But there's animals in the woods.
There are animals in the villa.
Now go.
Captain: Back in the shelter!
Go!
(GRUNTS)
Captain: Horses under cover!
Soldier: Aye, sir.
(SOBS)
What if your God does not exist?
My dear friend, what are you talking about?
Your God, my gods, what if they don't exist?
Well, if God or the gods don't exist, then nothing has meaning.
Or everything has meaning.
What on Earth does that mean?
Why do you need your God?
Well, if there were no gods, then anyone could do anything, and nothing would matter.
You could do as you liked and nothing would be real and nothing would have meaning or value.
So, even if the gods don't exist, it's still necessary to have them.
If they don't exist, then they don't exist.
We have to live with it.
Ah, yes, but you don't.
You don't live with it. You only think of death.
You only think of Valhalla.
(SIGHS)
And all you think about is heaven!
Which seems like a ridiculous place, where everybody is always happy.
Valhalla is ridiculous!
All the dead warriors get to fight again in the courtyard each morning, and kill each other again.
(CHUCKLES)
And then they all have supper together!
(CHUCKLES)
Then they are both ridiculous.

(EXHALES)
Athelstan...
Was a man of God.
And now he is dead.
Tell me what happened.
Floki killed him.
So your gods killed him.
No, Floki killed him out of jealousy.
Because I loved Athelstan more than him.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I was jealous, too.
When he chose to go back with you.
I felt his loss grievously, as if he'd torn part of myself away from myself.
(SIGHS)
He left because he loved me more.
Well, then...
You should have protected him.
He didn't need protecting.
What does that mean?
We needed him.
He never needed us.
If he'd stayed here with me, he'd still be alive.
He had enemies here also.
He belonged here with me. I would have protected him.
Who are you to say where he belonged?
He chose to be with me.
He chose his path and that was with me.
I am not to blame.
Now who's the one who's not being honest?
(CHAINS RATTLING)
Tell me this.
Do you think he is with your gods or with mine?
It does not matter.

I am making it my business to make friends with the sons of Ragnar.
(SCOFFS) Uh...

But I am afraid that we...
Yes.
You should be afraid.
That's what I came to tell you.

Then you can wash your hands of me.

We trust each other, yes?
Yes.

You arrange for a ship, for sailors.
You just make sure my son gets home safely.

And...

(CHAINS CLANK)
I will tell my son Ivar to tell his brothers that you did everything you could to save me.
That you and I, we are sworn friends and that King Aelle was solely responsible for my death.

They will spare you, my friend...
And they will take out all of their revenge on King Aelle.

Why would he give him to Aelle?

Our father is probably dead by now.
And we will have to avenge him.
That is what matters.

(EXHALES)
Oh, my Ragnar.
My love.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I am sorry.
Forgive me.
But, if he is dead, what will you do?
I must pick up the burden.
The burden?
Of ruling.
Ragnar hated it.
It weighed him down.
Perhaps it even killed him.
Then why do it to yourself?
I think Ragnar is looking at me, and I can't disappoint him.
Nor can I disappoint myself.
Or you.
Or Torvi.
Or any of the shield-maidens who have died fighting at my side.
If I walked away now, what would they say about me in Valhalla?
We have to prepare.
For what?
The sons of Ragnar.
The sons of Ragnar will come to claim vengeance.
Not upon me.
Only upon Aelle.
That was our agreement.
Your agreement?
Ha! With a pagan?
Yes.
Ragnar and I were alike in many ways.
I trusted him.
He trusted me.
I'm not talking about Ragnar.
I'm talking about his son.
Ivar?
He's a cripple.
He's a Viking!
You made a huge mistake releasing him.
Don't say that.
It's true.
I mean, don't contradict your father.
(SCOFFS)
I care about your father, and I believe in him.
Yes, I know you do, and I can never totally express my gratitude to you.
But Aethelwulf is right.
The sons of Ragnar will doubtless return to these shores.
And there is no better man than you, my son, to raise an army and make every preparation for our defense.
(EXHALES)
And, uh, what will you do, Father?
Oh, I'll continue my lessons with Alfred.
The boy's very responsible.
He's coming along nicely.
(BIRD CHIRPING)
(WOMAN SHOUTS IN THE DISTANCE)
What are we going to do?
If Father is dead...
Mother and Father.
I said \"If.\"
It is possible that Lagertha might change her mind about keeping us alive.
Of course she might.
How can we trust her?
We can't.
But if we try and kill her, all furies will be released.
And who would support us?
Mother and Father.
I can't believe it.
Even if it is true about Father, we must bide our time.
We would be fools to give ourselves away so quickly.
So, what about Ivar?
How do we control him?
You tell me, brother.

We do not know King Ragnar's fate, or whether he will ever return.
(MURMURING)
You have not been ruled properly for a long time, and many things have been neglected.
Kattegat has changed so much in the last few years.
It has grown and flourished. By all account, it is now the largest, richest trading center in Norway.
(CROWD MURMURING)
Which means that others are bound to be envious of our success.
And they must look at us and wonder why we make so little effort to protect ourselves.
It is my belief that we should begin to build fortifications, ditches and palisades, around this site.
And it is my hope, as your Queen, that everyone, men, women and children, the fit and the wounded, will contribute to this great work.
Those who share my belief say \"aye.\"
All: Aye!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

(GRUNTING)
Welcome, Ivar.
I've come here for justice.
Everyone knows that you killed my mother for no reason, except ambition.
Therefore, I demand justice.
Ivar...
Don't touch me, coward.
He is not a coward.
But perhaps he understands some things that you don't.
I understand everything perfectly.
You murdered my mother in cold blood.
I want revenge.
I challenge you to single combat.
(CROWD MURMURING)
I refuse.
You can't refuse.
I refuse to fight you, Ivar Lothbrok, son of Ragnar.
(MURMURING RESUMES)
Why?
Huh?
I don't want to kill you.
Who says you would kill me?
I do.
All right.
Don't fight me, then.
I don't care. Just as long as you know that one day, I will kill you, Lagertha.
Your fate is fixed.

Oh, we are lost and so am I.
What do you mean?
I no longer know who I am.
Why I am here.
What my purpose is.
You build boats.
It's not enough.
I feel like an empty vessel.
I am hollow.
I need something to fill me up.
I was so sick I thought I was going to die.
But I had time to think about everything.
About what I want from this life.
And I want a baby.
No, Helga.
Yes.
I need something more from this life.
But not a child.
Don't you remember?
Of course I remember.
How would I not remember?
There won't be a \"this time.\"
I have set my face against it.
I do not want another child.
What are you thinking about?
I was just wondering if Bjorn Ironside is cursed, like his father.
If we flounder, then the gods are surely displeased.
Then what shall we do?
We should not trust in his star, but in our own.
One day, we must overcome the Lothbroks, for how else can I become the King of all Norway?
And sometimes I think, why wait?
The gods will give us a sign.
They love us.
Will they try to kill you again?
Possibly.
I will stop them.
I will protect you.
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.
But if they're going to kill me, you won't be able to stop them.
No one will be able to stop them.

Yes.
Not only against Aelle.
I told you, King Ecbert offered our father up like a sacrifice, so we'll do the same thing to him.
That is what Father wanted.
That is the message that he wanted me to bring to you.
That is so easy to say, Ivar.
Here he is, the voice of reason.
I hate reason.
What do you mean, Ubbe?
I'm listening, even if he's not.
Aelle has a small kingdom but Ecbert's kingdom is vast.
How do we overcome that when we have never attempted anything like that before?
We raise an army.
No, you're not listening, brother.
We raise a great army.
An army bigger than ever before.
Sigurd is right.
We call in favors.
We do deals with Kings and Earls that we hate.
Whatever we have to promise them, we promise.
And in the end, we assemble an army twice the size of the army our father took to Paris.

I know very well what happened to Kattegat, Lagertha.
I was born here and I grew up here.
We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.
Will you come with us?
Would you really want me to come with you?
We will need all the help we can get.
After all, don't you have a reason?
I also have a reason to stay here.
I understand you are inviting other rulers to come and join your army.
Don't you think some of them will be envious when they see the size and understand the value of this trading station?
It depends, I suppose, on what is more important to you.
That's not worthy of you, Ubbe.
I know what your father would have wanted me to do.

So you feel sorry for yourself?

You're wrong, Ivar. I don't feel sorry for myself.
Yeah. Right. No. Of course not.
I'm telling you the truth.
I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.

What does it matter what your mother did to you?
She was still your mother.

You need not have concerned yourself as to travel so far.
Why should I not be aware of the habits of the heathen?
I promise you, we are already well prepared for any incursions into our kingdom.
I'm not sure you realize the scale of their possible retribution.
Ragnar Lothbrok was not only their King, Father, he was the most famous man in their world.
Believe me, daughter, I have taken stock of them.
I know what to expect.
And we are fully prepared.
Then should you not reinstate your alliance with King Ecbert?
I have no wish or need to be allied to such a degenerate monarch.
Daughter, we are all aware of your immoral relationship with your father-in-law.
It grieves us deeply.
We pray that you will return to your wedded husband and behave as a Christian wife ought to behave.
I am grateful for your concern, Mother.
But there is no need to pray for me.
If we do not pray for your soul, daughter, then you will be damned for all eternity.
If I am to hell, at least I will enjoy the company of my degenerate monarch.

Now, he asks questions such as, \"What kind of man he is or ought to be, who is to rule?\"
And, \"Can the occupation of power distract the mind of the ruler?\"
Yes, well, I can see that you're bored already.
No, Grandfather.
Good boy.
To the future.
To the future.
Drink up, drink up!
Here's the thing, Alfred.
Because God chooses you as King, you need to be a teacher to your people.
Do you understand that?
Yes, Grandfather.
Let's drink!
These are great matters!
Mmm, mmm!
All of it!
One day you may be King.
I hope so with all my heart.
And yet, I know its burdens.
They're very real, like forever dragging a stone up a hill, only to watch it perpetually roll back down again.
You need to drink more wine.
I don't want any more, Grandfather.
Nonsense, nonsense.
You'll join me in one more.
(SPITS)
Now, you keep saying you understand but you obviously don't.
I've just been drinking water, while you were drinking the wine.
Don't ever let yourself be influenced by other people.
Especially people like me.
Always, always think your own thoughts.
And act on them!
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Is this the place?
This is the pit where Ragnar died.
Yes. Thank God. Just in this place. Just here.
This is where the pagan died.
Then it is a sacred place.
How dare you say such things?
Are you mad?
I may be.
But since I love some of you, I urge you again to take heed of my warning.
The sons of Ragnar are sure to come!
As for you, sweet sister, I counsel you, have a care for your own soul.
And learn to read.
(HORN SOUNDS)
(CROWS CAWING)
Our first arrivals, huh?
For the greatest army ever assembled.
And they will be our instruments.
Our instruments of wrath.
(LAUGHING)
Are you really going to allow Lagertha to escape her punishment?
Hmm?
No.
We must have revenge.
Yes.
And sooner rather than later.
Why are we waiting?
(SEAGULLS CRYING)
(PEOPLE TALKING)
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHING)
My friends, welcome to Kattegat.
And who might you be?
My name is Ubbe.
Forgive me, Ubbe.
If I'd known, I would never have been so rude.
Your father was a great hero.
Perhaps the greatest hero of our race.
And that is why we have answered your summons, and come to avenge his death.
He was also like our father.
That we have all lost a father.
(LAUGHING)
Who's the cripple?
His name is Ivar and he's my brother.
So I would suggest you stop laughing at him right now.
Instead, if you want to stay alive, I would learn to respect and fear him.
That would be my advice.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Queen Lagertha.
Who are you?
Earl Jorgensen.
From Sweden.
We have come a long way to see you.
But it is a short distance to meet the famous shield-maiden, Queen Lagertha, and the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Ragnar and I were simple farmers.
I had no idea our fame had spread so far.
Are you joking?
It is almost tiresome to hear the poets talk of all your exploits.
I'm sorry it was tiresome.
Perhaps we should have done things a more interesting way.
No, no, no. That is the fault of the poets, not you.
And who is this?
This is Torvi, my son Bjorn's companion.
And this is Astrid, one of my shield-maidens.
I leave you in their company.
We'll see.
Really?
(PEOPLE JOKING AND LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND)
You had no right to free my slaves without my permission.
I don't remember you asking permission to kill my mother.
That's different. I am Queen now.
I know.
I just don't know for how long.
Ubbe!
I wanted to tell you.
You look just like your father looked when he was a young man.
When I first knew him.
(HUM OF PEOPLE IN DISTANCE)
(CHUCKLING)
Ah!
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHTER)
Something's happening.
What?
I don't know. But something!
(GASPING, STRUGGLING)
Lagertha!
What is happening here?
It's none of your business, Earl Jorgensen.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GASPS)
If you kill her, my brothers, you'll have to kill me too.
Maybe we should.
Shut up.
She killed our mother.
I know.
You want revenge.
So would I.
But more importantly, we have to avenge our father.
That is why I came back.
And that is what we are going to do.
(GRUNTS)
So you had your revenge?
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but think about it. If we...
Hvitserk!
(LAUGHING)
Welcome home, brother.
I heard you freed Margrethe?
You want to marry her. I'm glad.
Just don't keep her all to yourself.
Ubbe: It's good to have you back, brother.
Have you heard about Mother?
Yes.
Well, you and I, Ubbe, we jumped under the ice because of her.
So I don't quite agree that we should kill Lagertha because of it.
Ivar thinks we should.
Ivar's crazy. You know that.
Maybe we should wait.
Until we avenge our father.
Someone has to rule Kattegat when we're away.
And if we kill Lagertha, we have to kill Bjorn and I don't want to do that.
Well, maybe you couldn't do it anyways.
Would you want to test me, brother?
(SOUNDS OF PEOPLE WORKING)
Harald: Can you see what we mean, Egil?
Lagertha is building some serious defenses.
Egil: In my opinion, it doesn't matter how careful you are, there will always be weak places in the defense.
It just takes a clever person to figure out where the weak places are.
And are you a clever person, Egil?
Well, I'm not beautiful, am I?
(CHUCKLES)
Man: Pull!
(INHALES, EXHALES)
How can you go with Ivar, when he wants to kill your mother?
We're brothers.
We want to kill Aelle.
Nothing else matters right now, woman.
I don't understand.
Of course it matters.
It matters to me even if it doesn't matter to you!
(BABY CRYING)

I did not come back here to be told what to do.
Not by you, not by anyone!
(BABY SCREAMING)

Tanaruz.
Ah, ah.

Hello, Floki.
Helga.
Floki: Ivar.
So, who's this?
Her name is Tanaruz.
Oh, you brought her back?
She'll make a good slave, I'm sure.
She is not a slave.
We are adopting her.
She is my child.
Ah!
Well, let's see.
(GASPING)
Shh, it's all right.
I won't hurt you.
(SCREAMING)
It's all right.
Don't be afraid.
It's very sweet of you to drag your crippled arse all the way over here to see me.
Why do you think I want anything from you, you spindly legged, knock-kneed boat-builder?
It's nice to see how much you've matured since I've been away.
Matured? What, you think I want to be an old fool like you?
The way you behave, dear Ivar, you'll never get the chance.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(GROWLING WITH JOY)
Actually, might be something that you can do for me.
Oh.
Now that we're going to England to fight, it's about time I didn't have to crawl about.
Especially on the battlefield.
I wonder if you could help me, Floki.
I'll figure something out.
Come on, donkey.

Lagertha is building some serious defenses.
It doesn't matter how careful you are, there will always be weak places in the defense.
There is much talk of the revenge of the sons of Ragnar.
I know what to expect.
And we are fully prepared.

What shall we sacrifice?
This will be the largest army we have ever sent out.
If the army fails...
If they are defeated by the Saxons, our peoples might never recover.
Then I repeat, what shall we sacrifice?
I think Lagertha means, \"Who shall we sacrifice?\"
(BABY CRYING)
Ivar: I want to ask you something.
Who will be the leader of our great army?
Maybe there won't be a single leader, but many.
Father chose to take me with him to England.
(GRUNTS)
And what is your point, little brother, huh?
(SIGHS)
He told me that he wanted me to learn at first hand something of the Saxon ways.
The landscape, the buildings, and defenses.
He said it would be useful when we returned to avenge him.
Are you saying he wanted you to be our leader?
(CHATTERING)
Look!
What? What?
Harald: Can't you see her?
Halfdan: Who? See who?
Harald: It's her. It is!
No, it's not!
(FOGHORN BLOWING)
Yes, it is! You know it is!
That was the woman who made me believe I had to be King of all Norway before she would marry me.
That is my princess.
I think of her every day of my life.
That's her.
Well, then you ought to go say hello.

Ivar wants to lead the army.
What?
Are you serious?
He just told me. He thinks our father chose him.
It's not right.
Bjorn should lead the army.
I agree. Bjorn should be leader.
Then it's settled.
What did you say to Margrethe?
Uh...
I told her that I've always loved her.
But I understood you had first claim to her.

Ellisif: Princess Ellisif from Denmark.

You saw me, but you did not bother to come and say hello.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to marry you.
You turned me down.
I wasn't important enough for you.
But now...
I'm trying to be very important.
And I'm almost there.
(INHALES) Believe me.
I'm already married.
And when I succeed, become King of Norway, I can cut my hair and I can marry you.
I'm already married.

Him?
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Is he a king?
No.
He's...
An Earl in Denmark.
An Earl?
Yes.
But I was already a king and I was not good enough for you.
I'm sorry.
You keep saying that.
You're so sorry.
But the point is...
You told me you would wait and marry me when I become very...

But in the meantime, you marry a nobody!

We refuse to share power with any of the other Kings and Earls, whoever they are, or however powerful they are.

Is that understood?
We are all equally Ragnar's sons, but we are not equal in battle.
So I will take the lead.
I will establish the battle plans, and I will give the orders.
Do you understand that?
You don't agree, Ivar?
I didn't say anything.
You don't have to.
Your age makes you believe you know more than you do.
(SNIFFING)
But what do you know?

You are also about to receive a great heathen army.
They have landed on the coast.
Thank you. Now, get out!
The Lord comes before all things.
Corpus Christi.
Amen.
They are here.
Who? Who's here?
The great heathen army.
You'd better listen to me, Father.
I am. I'm listening.
This is the army which has come to revenge the death of Ragnar Lothbrok.
And it's all your fault.
How is it all his fault?
He freed Ragnar's son.
Who would have told them everything.
Who would have told them that we gave Ragnar Lothbrok to King Aelle to be killed.
Sometimes, God does things to test us.
This has nothing to do with God!
This has to do with you.
And with me.
Now, as you are my wife, I could order you to leave my Father and I alone.
But you're not like most wives.
So I simply ask if you would do so.
You're angry with me.
Of course I'm angry with you.
Most of my life, you've either manipulated or humiliated me.
You used me to fulfill your ambition, while at the same time taking my wife as your mistress and forcing me to adopt her b*st*rd son.
Please, tell me...
What kind of a father are you?
You're not behaving like a King anymore.
People are already talking about it.
You're distracted, you're withdrawn.
You seem unsure, and hesitant, when once you were firm, you were strong.
Oh, I am filled with doubts.
And I've begun to believe that being firm and strong was the illusion and that I am unsure now because it is the most honest way to be.
Not in the face of a great heathen army that are come to destroy us.
That is why I have placed you in command of our armies.
I trust you completely.
It's why I always used you.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You loved Athelstan.
Right?
You loved Ragnar Lothbrok.
You love Judith.
Right?
Do you love me, Father?
Do you?
Because if you do, I want you to say so.
I need you to say so. (SNIFFLES)
Please.
Please.
(SNIFFLES)
Judith warned us.
She had no need to warn us. I was already prepared.
I'm still frightened.
It is in the interests of the Northmen to have a reputation as great warriors.
It's half the battle.
It sows the seeds of fear in those who oppose them.
But, believe me, I'm not afraid.
I don't believe in their reputation.
God knows, I hope it is the sons of Ragnar who have landed on our shores.
For I have prepared a very special welcome for them.
They're about to discover they can no longer attack us with impunity.

Well, I'm sorry to hear it.
For all our sakes.
That great army is doubtless on its way here already.
I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.
If it really is as great as the bishop suggested, then I'll need some extra time to raise more men at arms.
I agree. But now time itself is of the essence.

As I'll also try to be worthy of you, Judith.
To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the sun.
A time to love, and a time to hate.
A time of war, and a time of peace.
Now this is the time of war!
This is the time to hate!

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
It seems to me that the Saxons are as timid as frightened women.
Their hearts are faint.
I don't think they can truly trouble us.
You don't know enough, Ivar.
You haven't seen enough.
These are brave men.
I've fought against them, you haven't.
I can only see what my eyes tell me, Bjorn.
And what I see is frightened people running before us.
I see their spineless God running away from our gods.
For once, why don't you just listen to an older, wiser brother?
These people who are running away, they're not warriors.
They are not the ones who will stay and fight to defend this kingdom.
And protect their honor.
For what is a warrior without his honor?
(CHUCKLES) I don't know. You tell me, brother.
And, tell me again, how many battles have you fought?
Same as you, brother, except I don't ride around in a comfortable bloody chariot!
What you have to learn, Ivar, is that if you break up this brotherhood, we shall not succeed.
We have many challenges ahead of us.
So, if you want to keep arguing and whining like a little girl, then I suggest you leave.
We don't need you.
Ivan: Oh, but you do need me.
Why do you think father chose me to come with him to England?
He had a reason for doing so.
He told me I was the one who would act for him, who would make sure he was revenged.
Bjorn: If that's what you want to think, then think it.
(ALL LAUGH)
I understand it must be hard for you to accept that the true heir to the great Ragnar Lothbrok should turn out to be a cripple and a reject.
(LAUGHS)
So this is what the grunting of the little pigs was all about.
Saxon Captain: No, not there!
Saxon Soldier: Where shall I put them?
(HORSE WHINNIES)
(MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
Man: He's here!
Lord Aethelwulf!
Soldier: There he is!
Prince Aethelwulf!
(ALL CHEERING)
What's your estimation of their strength? Honestly.
Who can tell?
Between three or four thousand.
That's what it looked like to me.
We've never seen anything like this before.
Not a raiding party, but a great, heathen army.
Where were they headed?
They killed King Aelle near York and they're moving south into the midlands, so far, towards Repton.
Is it your belief that they are set upon attacking my father's kingdom?
That they have gathered together to attack Wessex?
There is no doubt in my mind.
These are the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.
They want revenge for the death of their father.
They killed Aelle.
But they know your father was complicit in his death.
So it seems inevitable that they are marching towards Wessex.
I believe this man.
I always thought they would seek revenge against my father.
So let's move towards Repton.
I think our destiny awaits us there.
Helga: Tanaruz!
Floki, get up!
(GASPING) Floki!
Hmm?
What is it?
She's gone.
Tanaruz is gone.
(SIGHS)
Maybe it's for the better.
What are you talking about?
Something frightened her and she's run away.
She might be in danger, Floki! Floki, we have to find her!
Where is my darling? (SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Floki, find her, please.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Tanaruz?
(GASPS)
I'm sorry.
You hate us. I...
I don't know what to do.

Leave.
All right.
I admit.
I was a fool not to kill her.
You were a fool to think that she would always wait for you.
You were a fool to think that she loved you.
How could she marry that nobody?
Maybe she loves him.
And, if she loves him, then he is somebody.
How are you suddenly so wise, brother?
It may have escaped your attention but I am not married myself.
You know why?
I don't understand women any more than you do.
Women are fickle.
Forget her.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Ellisif?
I came to forgive you.
It is not your fault you could not wait for me.
You probably thought it was an impossible task you had set me, in any case.
I was never supposed to achieve it.
You never really intended to marry me, did you?
I'm sorry.
I don't even know your name.
My name is Vik, King Harald.
I am happy to meet you.
Believe me, I knew nothing of this...

Who paid for your army, Egil the b*st*rd?
Why should I tell you?
You will kill me, burn me alive, whether I tell you or not.
That's not true.
Of course it's true!
Don't play games.
As you can see, I have no time for games.
We found your wife.
(PANTING)
Look at her!
We have told her that if you tell us who paid for your fleet and attack then we will spare your life.
That you and your wife can live together again, happily.
I don't know this woman.
(SIZZLING)

(HORN BLOWING)
You can make camp.
I want to take a look at where we're going to fight.
What are you talking about?
They will expect us to fight in a certain way.
Why should we do that?
Why don't we plan to fight in a different way, and surprise them?
Our warriors won't understand what's happening.
We fight in the shield-wall. That's how we fight.
But we have a bigger army now.
And they have a bigger army, now, Hvitserk.
We cannot fight in the same way.
It's too late to change now.
Who are you to say that? Shut your mouth.
We are brothers.
Together!
Why do you want to change the tactics?
Do you want to win, brother?
Listen, come with me, Bjorn.
Let's investigate the battlefield.
Perhaps, instead of a narrow and small place, we should stretch the battlefield across a large area, many miles.
And use the landscape.
Ditches, hills, woods.
What do you say?
If it works, it is a good plan.
If it doesn't, then it is a bad plan.

But people persuaded me.
They lied to me. Can you understand?
Your dream seemed a long time away.
But I was wrong, so wrong, I should have waited!

This is God's will.

Now go fetch Bishop Edmund.
Do you, Ecbert, anointed King of Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia, Cornwall, Bretwalda, king of kings, in the sight of God almighty renounce all your thrones and kingdoms in favor of your son and heir, Prince Aethelwulf?
I do. So help me God.
And so, let me remove from you the sacred emblems and signs of your kingship.
I give this holy scepter into your hands, Prince Aethelwulf.
And with this ancient crown, I do make thee king over all those places and kingdoms once ruled by your father, but now by you instead.
In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I crown you King Aethelwulf.
May God save and protect you, all the days of your life.

Love is everything.
All shall be well.
All shall be well.
Now, now you... You have a destiny, Alfred, that you cannot escape.
So you better get used to it.
In the meantime, listen and learn.
Listen to the highest and the lowest.
Learn from the prince, and from the shepherd.
And, remember, the greatest Christian virtue, Alfred, is humility.

We have to decide what to do with King Ecbert!
Ivar: I don't understand.
What is there to discuss?
We Blood Eagle him.
Ecbert is as guilty as Aelle so we should do the same thing to him.
I've told you this too many times, brothers. I was here!
I saw Ecbert hand father over to King Aelle.
We all understand those feelings, Ivar.
No one is denying what you are saying.
But sometimes...
Sometimes.
We have to consider things beyond our feelings.
And think what is best for our people!
I know what our people want, Bjorn.
And they want what I want.
We have to consider our position of strength.
And use that to our ultimate advantage!
(LAUGHING)
You always like to complicate things, Bjorn.
You think it makes you look clever.
And what if we kill Ecbert, Ivar? Huh? What then?
Well, then he's dead, Ubbe!
We are in the middle of an enemy kingdom.
How long will it be before the Saxon forces gather up another army and drive us away?
Exactly!
So we Blood Eagle Ecbert and then we move on.
We raid this entire land, so that they never have a chance to assemble another army again.
(SIGHS)
Why would we even want to stay here?
It is what our father wanted.
He didn't just want to win battles.
He wanted land here.
He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.
Mmm. And we all know what happened.
Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.
We do.
What about you, Sigurd?
You've been very quiet so far.
I'm sure you have an opinion. (LAUGHS)
I agree with you, Ivar.
Excuse me?
We should Blood Eagle him.
Finally, thank you.
But I'm not sure.
I'm not sure what they're saying.
What I am saying is that we should do what our father always wanted.
Yes?
I'd like to speak.
Well, I understand most of what you say, and I speak a little of your language now.
(SIGHS)
I loved your father.
He was my friend.
And I know that, more than anything, he wanted to build a farming community here.
Ivar: And you killed all the settlers.
Ecbert: Yes. It's true. I did.
But... (LAUGHS)
(CHAINS RATTLE)
Now the tables have turned.
We can make a new deal.
What are you proposing?
Well, as you say, it's only a matter of time before you are driven away from here.
Without any legal right to English lands, you have no hope of staying.
Well.
I am king of kings.
And I can give you that legal right.
I will give you legal claim to the kingdom of East Anglia.
It's a large kingdom.
Because I am king, no one can question that claim.
And it seems that...
You have enough men to enforce it until it holds.
That's my offer.
You should consider it.
(GROANS)
What do you want in return?
I'll only tell you that once you agree to my proposal.
Not that I need to ask...
(CHUCKLES)
But what is your opinion?
About whether to accept the gift of land from King Ecbert?
Yes.
Well, since you do ask me, my opinion is that we should take the land.
But I have one condition...
That Ecbert dies.
And that I Blood Eagle him.
Otherwise, there is no deal.
You wouldn't be able to stand up long enough to Blood Eagle him.
I imagine me sitting.
I accept your offer of land.
But for what you did to my father...
You must die.
Then I'll tell you what it is I want.
All I want is to choose the manner of my own death.
I agree.
Bjorn Ironside, son of Ragnar.
I, King Ecbert, give you the right to settle the lands of East Anglia.
And I pray you succeed.
And now...
I have a final journey to take.
I'm sorry to hear of Helga's death.
We knew each other a long time.
Since I was a boy.
I too am dead, Bjorn.
A part of me died with my daughter Angrboda, a second part with Ragnar, and the last part of what was Floki died with my sweet, sad Helga.
What I am now is nothing.
And all this nothing I give to the gods, to do with as they please.
And I shall be an empty ship with no rudder, set upon their endless sea.
And where they take me, I shall go.
Take care, Bjorn.

Friends...
No one will ever be able to doubt what we have achieved!

(CHEERING)
For us, the sons of Ragnar, our first duty was to avenge our father's death. And that we have done.
But also, we have achieved my father's dream.
We have the legal right to the land, and to farm here!
(CHEERING)
It is up to all of you to use this opportunity to send over new settlers and young families!
Unfortunately, I will not be here to see this new settlement grow and thrive.
My fate will take me elsewhere.
I always knew I had to return to explore the Mediterranean Sea.
And now I feel free to follow my destiny.
But, my brothers will be here for you.
Skol!
Crowd: Skol!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Ivar: I will be here but not to settle down and plow!
Who wants to be a farmer now?
Hmm?
We have a great army and we should use it.
There are many other places that I want to attack and raid!
And those of you who feel like I do, you should come with me.
And those of you who don't, ask yourself, \"Who can stand in our way now?\"
(CHEERING)
You cannot lead the army, Ivar. Hmm?
I don't want to, Ubbe.
All I'm saying is that, for those who are still brave enough to raid and find adventure, then I will lead them.
You can put on an apron and settle down if you want to.
Hvitserk: It will take a great man, Ivar.
To stake a claim here. Defend it.
Ah... That does not sound like yourself, dear brother.
The Hvitserk I know, he loves to raid. He's a real Viking.
What you just said, that is not the Viking way.
So...
Who among you will follow me?
Who will follow me into battle?
For the love of fame and for the love of Odin, our All Father?
(CROWD CHEERING)
Yeah!
All: Odin!
Don't do this, Ivar.
We are all the sons of Ragnar. We have to stick together.
Frankly, dear Sigurd, I don't care what you say.
The truth is, I wouldn't even piss down your throat even if your lungs were on fire.
(CROWD LAUGHING)
Well, maybe that's because you're not really a man!
Are you, Boneless?
(CROWD MURMURING)
Bjorn: So, who is going to stay and farm?
I would like to stay.
But I have other plans.
Skol.
All: Skol!
As for me...
I want to go with Bjorn.
I want to see the Mediterranean.
Then it seems, the only thing that really kept the sons of Ragnar together was the death of their father.
Poor Bjorn! It is you who doesn't want to keep the army together.
It is you who wants to go away to sunny places.
Everyone else can follow me.
I do not want to follow you, Ivar.
You are crazy.
You have the mind of a child!
And all you do is play music, Sigurd!
I'm just as much a son of Ragnar as you are.
I'm not so sure.
As far as I remember, Ragnar didn't play the oud.
And he certainly didn't offer his arse to other men!
(CROWD LAUGHING)
You make me laugh. Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.
Shut your mouth!
Enough!
This has nothing to do with you!
What's the matter, Ivar? You can't take it?
Ivar, do not listen to him.
No, I guess it must be hard for you now that your mommy's dead.
Knowing she's the only one who ever really loved you.
Ubbe: Ivar... Ivar!
