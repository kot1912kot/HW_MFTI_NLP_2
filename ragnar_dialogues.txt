The Earl will deal with some criminal offences and then, we'll discuss the summer raids.
The Earl decides.
I went to confess my love to her but I was set upon by a bear and an enormous hound who guarded her home.
And...?
That's right.
Say I wasn't there.
Why don't you go lie down, hmm?
I know.
Now, this candle is the sun.
That's it!
He wants to die well, without fear, to atone for his sins.
He should not have done that.
My lord, we all want to feast, but we also want to know where we will be raiding this summer.
Every year we go to the same places!
Let me see!
Stay with your Uncle.
I can't be sure.
To talk to the gods.
I want to know what the gods have in store.
To have this great future, must I challenge the law?
Wait outside.
We have someone special to visit.
Yes, only different.
Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.
Why unfortunately?
Floki is a boat-builder...
So... what about our boat?
The hull is deeper. How will my men set their oars?
For the anchor.
Hmm.
Let him stay awhile.
Hey!
We are brothers.
I saw something.
Set the sail.
No she bloody won't!
Shut up, man.
Previously on \"Vikings\":
We should sail west.
Erik.
See, all you lot live idle and wasted lives.
Across the great sea, to a place called England, where countless riches await us.
Ahh!
I already told you.
I need to leave the children and the farm in the hands of someone I trust.
My love!
Now listen...
We were just having an argument.
I still don't see Knut.
Get the bucket.
Storm's coming.
You heard him!
Tent!
Are you afraid?
Floki, sit down.
Release the ravens.
Woo!
Row! We made it!
They know we're here.
Perhaps they think their God protects them.
You speak our language.
How do you speak our language?
What is that you have in your hand?
Of all the treasures I see in this place, you chose to save this?
I believe they are the priests of their God.
I forbid it.
Keep them moving!
The Earl knows nothing about our new boat.
We did it, brother.
You're right.
Are you coming, Knut?
My lord, it was easy to take all of these things.
My lord, me and Floki paid for the boat.
I will take the priest for my slave.
He was looking for an excuse to kill us.
Why don't you go get drunk, spend all this on whores.
Little man...
Here, you can touch him.
Athelstan.
Come on.
We don't like those in our house to go hungry or thirsty.
I want to sail west again.
He has informed me of a large town, near to the temple that we raided before.
Shhh!
Run away if you want.
I have the Earl's permission to sail back to england.
Tomorrow.
The priest.
I don't regard him as a slave.
Hmm...
Believe me, this is not the end.
I want to leave as soon as possible.
Arne, what day is it today?
Just wait!
And listen!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Open!
Lagertha: Ragnar!  Close the wall!
The saxons attacked us when we returned to the boat, in great force,  But we defeated them!
My lord!
Floki.
Will you drink with me?
Ungh!
It is true that we distinguish between those captured in battle, and our own free men and women.
If it matters so much to you.
We have to go now.
We have to get to the boat.
Boy, don't argue!
I'm right behind you. Now go.
Save me from these people.
It is good to see you.
Sometimes your God sounds a lot like one of ours.
Why did the gods keep me alive?
I can do nothing until I am well.
Floki can always build us another one.
No, there are many halls.
It's taken too long already.
Floki.
Previously on \"Vikings\":
He is old.
Who sets the odds?
You are wrong: I do believe it.
Don't look so worried.
Leif, you are my friend.
These other servants are preparing her.
Previously on \"Vikings\":
Soon enough.
Yes, I can see them.
Who are you?
You are the brother of the king, yet you lead his army?
What ails you my friend?
This?
Attack, attack, attack!
You forget, we hold his brother hostage.
Hello.
Hmm...
Good.
When we receive payment, you shall have your brother.
You want one of us to become Christian?
Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala, to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us.
Lord of lords, father, hear my prayer.
Can you feel it, Gyda?
Give Athelstan a drink.
It is not a rumor.
Athelstan, I want you to meet someone.
Travelers and storytellers have described how you came to your throne by defeating, one by one, the six uncles that killed your father.
I also know how you favor the poets at your court, and your people respect your law making, your justice, and your rule.
Looks like your God finally came through for you.
Lord of lords, who will bear me my son?
He wants to make peace with you and come to some kind of agreement.
Not if he fights well.
King Horik resists your claim, but still, in good faith, he is willing to settle with you.
Well then, it seems I am done.
I have not been given the authority to... negotiate in this manner.
Floki!
I never knew that fresh fish was also packed in salt.
I hung from a windy tree for nine long nights, wounded by a spear, dedicated to Odin, from that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.
We shall finally go west again.
Do you ever miss England?
Athelstan: Sometimes.  Come with me.
What is that place?
How did you know?
Who was this?
You keep talking to me like I know what a Saint is.
So tell me, how do you find England?
Well, that depends.
Upon what he'll offer us to leave... or what he'll offer us to stay.
Yes, we want to make peace with the king.
Who made all of these things?
That he might offer us land.
He wants something in return.
You can't even speak their language.
Athelstan is a free man.
Are my family here?
Little man.
Hello, son. Oh, I've missed you.
You still have it. Ubbe: Yes.
No more prophecies.
Shall we talk?
I want to attack Kattegat. Now!
And you are?
Far too long.
Then we find more men.
Enough with the pleasantries, let's make a plan.
No. My son and I shall go.
Olrik, Erik, sneak through the water to the docks.
Don't fear death.
Watch out!
Quickly!
Get up! Get up!
Stop!
I love two women.
No. I don't want to choose.
This is going to be a long story.
Hmm.
But they didn't?
What are you talking about?
It is good to see them playing together.
Mmm...
Quiet! Thorvard.
We shall speak later.
Previously on \"Vikings\":
What about Athelstan?
I want to destroy Jarl Borg and to kill him with my bare hands.
Tell us, Erlendur, what happened in England, after we left?
If you say so.
Please.
Put Jarl Borg's men in the barn which the servants use.
I am sorry, that the ambiance of Kattegat has awoken you.
Since you consort with eagles, I will draw a blood-eagle on your back...
Previously on \"Vikings\":
Because he is the king.
After all, your prophecy was right.
It is natural.
Thank you.
So he knows that we are here to talk...
I thought you would both agree.
Because it is a sensible policy.
I will try to remember that the next time, Earl Ingstad.
Wait.
The unexpected.
I am prepared.
This is Athelstan's.
Then...
Previously on \"Vikings\":
King Horik, your behaviour has made it very difficult to talk peace or to negotiate with King Ecbert.
This was a gift in good faith.
I will go myself and talk to him.
He is not truly dead. That is his curse.
This is the place.
Form!
Yah! Hyah!
Stop!
You fought well today.
You were favoured by the Gods.
Well, King, what are we fated to do?
I will accompany you, part of the way.
So have you returned to your faith, renounced ours?
I hope that someday our Gods can become friends.
What do you say?
What about my brother?
I accept the offer.
Hello, brother.
I am taking my brother home. Will you come back with us or will you stay here with... your people?
I believe there's a way to go west using this.
We won't know that until we try.
It was easy to take all of these things.
You will not regret this.
Until the odds are in our favor.
Who are you?
Shall we go visit the king?
Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us.
These will all be killed as sacrifices.
I see no reason why you two should not get on together.
I want you to stay here.
I'm surprised to hear you say that, for you know my family better than anyone.
Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
The offender gets down on his knees. And his back is opened. And then his ribs are chopped away from his spine. And then his lungs are pulled out of this huge bleeding wound and laid upon his shoulders so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle.
I believe there's a way to go west using this.
You will not regret this.
I killed him.
Yes.
Until the odds are in our favour.
Who are you?

Yes.
I see no reason why you two should not get on together.
I am surprised to hear you say that.
What did you call him?
Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
The offender gets down on his knees... and his back is opened.
Will you teach me one of your prayers?
Our Father, Who art in heaven...
Tell me about Paris.
Then you're a Christian again?
The others will try again tonight.
Yes!
Come with me.
And the offer is not enough.
I am a dying man.
Last season, on Vikings...
You betrayed my trust and my love for you.
Previously on Vikings...
Thor came to a deep channel.
Previously on Vikings...
Previously on Vikings...
How the little piggies will grunt, when they hear how the old boar suffered.
It gladdens me to know that Odin prepares for a feast.
They will avenge me.
