and characters to emerge.\\nHail Earl Ragnar.\\nI\\'m not making a documentary, but I do want authenticity.\\nAnd I want to get as near to the truth as I can.\\nRagnar Lothbrok, I\\'ve heard that name before.\\nHail Earl Ragnar!\\nHail Earl Ragnar!\\nWell, clearly I needed a hero for the series.\\nI needed a lead character.\\nAnd so I was looking for an important Viking.\\nI was looking for a Viking who made a difference.\\nBut with the Vikings, obviously, there is plenty of debate about who is who and what was what and what happened, because the Vikings were a non-literate culture. they didn\\'t write anything down themselves.\\nThis is a real cultural treasure, this manuscript.\\nIt\\'s written around 1400.\\nIt was given as a gift to the Danish King.\\nWhat is special about this manuscript is this is the only complete manuscript of Ragnar saga that we have.\\nThe saga tells about Ragnar as a young man going on raids and acting in wars, what he has achieved, how many people he has killed, how young he was when he went to war for the first time.\\nAnd his fearlessness.\\nThe historicity of Ragnar Lothbrok, did he exist or not, is also one of the endearing puzzles of Viking\\'s culture.\\nA big part of Ragnar\\'s story is the story of his sons and people like Bjorn Ironside were real, they were absolutely real.\\nWe know this.\\nWe know of the things they did, the adventures they had.\\nYour father is Ragnar Lothbrok.\\nFor so many known real Vikings to have claimed the same person as their literal father, that\\'s not going back very far in time.\\nYour father is a person that people would have met, that to me argues that he has a basis in fact.\\nHa!\\nDo I think Ragnar existed?\\nYes, I think he did, but I don\\'t think that we are able to know much for certain about him.\\nOne of the central characters in the TV series is Lagertha, Ragnar\\'s wife.\\nIda, is your mother teaching you how to use a shield?\\n(Shouting)\\nYes, I know how to use a shield.\\nYour mother was a famous shield maiden.\\nWas?\\nIs.\\nI discovered that there was a certain amount of ambivalence in the books I was reading about shield maidens, and whether they really existed.\\nVikings society\\'s attitude towards women was far more enlightened than the Francs or the Saxons.\\nYou bear a strong resemblance to my ex-wife.\\nWomen could own property, divorce their husbands, fight, rule sometimes.\\nIt seemed perfectly logical, therefore, that they had to fight.\\n(Shouting)\\nSo, I was quite determined, from the start, not only to have a major female character, who wasn\\'t just going to be a housewife, but to have women fighting alongside men.\\nShield wall!\\nThere was some pushback on that.\\nThere was some resistance to that idea.\\nIt\\'s always been a source of great controversy in Viking studies that is, whether these women, these warrior women, were real or a part of the mythology.\\nThese are great warrior heroines doing brave things, and sacrificing themselves for the sake of their lovers or taking power in their own right.\\nThe gods are always smiling at brave women.\\nLike the Valkyries, those furies who men fear and desire.\\nI know that you prefer her because she\\'s a shield maiden, a warrior.\\nThe classic image of the shield maiden is very much one that derives from the written sources.\\nSo these are after the Viking age.\\nThe key question is how valid are they for the Viking age itself?\\nAnd from those texts, quite frankly, we can\\'t really say.\\nThey might go back to real living people who did this.\\nThey might be heroic embellishments.\\nBut the way to try and nuance that picture, to go back to the real Viking age, is to look at the archeology.\\nNow, we find a lot of these.\\nThey\\'re all from the late 9th and 10th century.\\nThe design is of a figure on a horse, with a standing figure in front of the horse.\\nAnd both of them appear to be female.\\nAnd the really crucial thing about these is that both of them are armed.\\nAnd just from these alone, we can start to make tentative reconstructions of what these kinds of figures would have looked like if they were real.\\nWhat does it mean?\\nBecause it quite clearly meant something in the Viking age.\\nThe first thing that we can say about this is that the idea of the armed women, is absolutely there in the Viking mind.\\nBut that still doesn\\'t tell us whether or not these depict supernatural women or whether there really were female warriors in the Viking age.\\n(Swords clanking)\\nNow we come to another new find, that was actually dug out of a block of frozen soil, in new year 2012.\\nSo a very recent find at a place called Hornby in Denmark.\\nAnd for the first time, instead of these two dimensional, flat pendants, we find a three dimensional actual model of a warrior woman.\\nShe has the same facial features of other pendants that we find with female faces.\\nShe\\'s holding a shield with the same swirling patterns that we find on these flat ones, and a sword.\\nWhat archeology is now starting to show is that there are images of armed women from the Viking age.\\nShield wall!\\n(Shouting)\\nFor a long time, we\\'ve known that there are occasional finds of the burials of women with weapons in the grave.\\nBut we haven\\'t been finding what we would call warrior burials of women.\\nUntil relatively recently, when a grave from a site called Birka, a grave excavated actually in the 1870\\'s, so a long time ago, absolutely packed with weapons.\\nWe can see it here, two shields, a sword, two spears, an ax, a fighting knife.\\nAnd for a long time this has been reconstructed in the books and exhibitions, as one of the absolute classic warrior graves of the Viking age.\\nFine.\\nBut, recently, a team of osteologists, these are archeologists specializing in the study of bones, lead by a very talented Stockholm researcher, called Anna Shelstrom, has been looking at the skeleton from this grave.\\nAnd I\\'m sure you can guess what I\\'m gonna say.\\nIt\\'s the body of a woman.\\nSo, this is a woman buried with this massive collection of weapons, on the same basis as we tend to interpret most graves.\\nThis would be the burial of a shield maiden.\\nWhen we take the two dimensional figures, the new three dimensional figures from Hornby, and the grave from Birka, that adds up to a pretty compelling picture of what these warrior women may actually have looked like.\\nAnd the really important part of this is that all these finds are from the Viking age itself.\\nThese are not from the literary text world of the saga\\'s.\\nThis is the Viking age as it really was.\\nShield wall!\\nI have to be clear that there\\'s a range of scholarly opinions on this.\\nBut certainly I think it\\'s quite probable that these women were real.\\nHalt!\\nYou must be the famous shield maiden Lagertha.\\nAnd they say that you are now an earl in your own right.\\nHow did it happen?\\nI killed my husband when he invaded me.\\n(Laughing)\\nThe great hall was central to Viking society.\\nI remember when this great hall was always full of laughter.\\n(Laughing)\\nIn some ways it\\'s a metaphorical place, and it\\'s a symbolic place.\\n(Distant chatter)\\nIt\\'s a metaphor for a lot of the politics that goes on, the conspiracy, the murders, and these raids.\\nAnd it\\'s symbolic because, you know, it symbolizes a lot of Vikings values.\\nIt is our custom to celebrate such an alliance as the gods celebrated theirs.\\nSkol!\\nWe\\'re feasting and with pledges.\\nSkol!\\nThe bonds of loyalty, of obligation, of hospitality, are the cement that holds Viking society together.\\nAnd the great hall is the arena where all those things were played out and displayed and spoken of and demonstrated.\\nNeil: And here we are in Lejre, where we have some of the largest Viking age holes ever found.\\nWhat we\\'ve just stepped into here is truly a residence fit for a king.\\nDefinitely.\\nSo, we\\'re looking at what, five meters of timber above us here?\\nYeah.\\nWith roof supporting posts in the middle.\\nAnd these posts, they\\'re almost tree\\'s aren\\'t they?\\nAnna: Yep.\\nI mean they\\'re huge things, like this...\\nThere probably would have been a kind of partition wall here or something.\\nYou don\\'t walk directly into the hall, which I think is very important in these houses, also that they show that access is controlled.\\nThe king had his own seat in the hall.\\nThe high seat.\\nThe high seat, yeah.\\nYou would probably have benches along the walls.\\nI\\'ve probably just walked through the fire.\\nIt\\'s not very wise.\\n(Laughing)\\nNeil: So you have a big rectangular fireplace in the middle of the structure and this isn\\'t just like a small wood fire, these are big, big things.\\nWe\\'re talking about something that would have been this wide and really long.\\nA big blaze of light in the middle.\\nSo the hall is the absolute centre of Viking life.\\n\\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\nHere we are in a very wet and tough walk.\\nCan you tell me what we\\'re seeing here?\\nYa, I mean it might not look like much, but we\\'re right in the middle of a huge Viking age settlement.\\nIt\\'s going all the way up to the green barn over there.\\nThere\\'s a small dip where the settlement stops, and it goes all the way into the next field as well.\\nThis is not a culture that left behind enormous monuments like The Coliseum or the Taj Mahal.\\nThis is a culture that built in wood, leather things like that.\\nAnd these are all things that rot away.\\nSo our knowledge of the Vikings comes from excavations of their settlements and their graves.\\nSo Anna, this is material from your excavations at Toftegaard.\\nIt is, it is.\\nThis is quite high end stuff.\\nNot every family would have had something like this.\\nYou dip this into the pot and bring out your big chunk of meat.\\nIt\\'s finds like this that, apart from anything else, tells us about the status of this place.\\nBecause, of course, everybody has to eat, but not using utensils like this.\\nNo, no, no, no.\\nSo you can see how finely made this is.\\nYou can see the traces of decoration in the centre there.\\nThis twisted band.\\nThe feast.\\nFeasting is a big component as to what goes on in these buildings.\\nYou would receive the hospitality of the lord of the hall.\\nSkol.\\nBut, in return, you would pledge a loyalty to him, either in terms of, contributing to the upkeep of his community or, more particularly, in war.\\nNow, who will be the first to drink in celebration?\\nIt\\'s better without the bag.\\nThis is really interesting.\\nNeil: Oh, wow!\\nHeavy, too.\\nYa!\\nIt was guilded.\\nSo this originally would have been shiny and bright like gold.\\nWhen we\\'re talking about the halls, they are very dim environments.\\nThey\\'re lit by the fire, and this kind of jewellery...\\nThe firelight would reflect off it.\\nSo people are walking about and they\\'d shimmer as they moved.\\nI wanna show you this bit.\\nAnna: It might not look of much, but I think it tells an interesting story.\\nIt\\'s probably a rim of a bowl and it\\'s probably looted.\\nWe can see that, from the art, that it comes from the British Isles.\\nNeil: This is quite possibly a monastic object, actually from the monastery.\\nAnd given the date of Toftegaard, which is the late 8th century.\\nThis is exactly the time of the raids on the British monasteries.\\nSo they\\'re proper Vikings.\\n(Laughing)\\nDon\\'t mess with them, no.\\nNeil: The lord would redistribute that wealth.\\nYou know, you helped me with this raid, here are rings and bullion and all kinds of loot.\\nAnd that would also then trickle down into the rest of society.\\nThis is also what makes it a bit unstable, a little bit dangerous.\\nWhat a hoard is this.\\nWhat a hoard it is!\\nAnd the earls, they only existed and survived as long as they provided for their people, in other words, as long as the raiding parties were successful, as long as they were strong.\\nIf they weren\\'t, they were just disposed.\\nIt was just as simple as that.\\nThe world is changing, and we must change with it.\\nPeople are ambitious and they like to go up the social scale.\\nSo it\\'s a society that\\'s in a constant kind of tension.\\nI\\'ve even heard some people say that Earl Ragnar is becoming like Earl Haraldson.\\nPeople would rather like to get up there, and the people up there would rather they didn\\'t.\\nBut they still need them in order to maintain their own position.\\nAnd all of this is being acted out in the space of the hall.\\nRagnar Lothbrok.\\nDo you imagine ships such as dead things?\\n(Waves crashing)\\nWe\\'ve blown miles off course.\\nWho knows where we are.\\nI joke about many things, but never about ship building.\\nIt\\'s my fault, and the gods love my faults.\\nThe ship is like the symbol of the Viking age.\\nIt\\'s amazing to me that nobody else had boats anything like them.\\nThe Saxons had no way of protecting the coastlines or rivers from Vikings.\\nOne fantastic thing about the Skuldelev ships was that it represented five different ship types.\\nFinding these fantastic Skuldelev ships allowed us to build reconstructions and then we could do experimental archeology by building them, by sailing it.\\nI\\'ve just noticed some of the repairs.\\nThere is actually one right here.\\nIt\\'s a bit difficult to see from the outside, but we can try it.\\nHere you can see the plank.\\nIt\\'s one plank put into another plank.\\nThere is a new overlap here.\\nThat is exactly how we do our repairs.\\nI can tell which trees would make the best planks just by looking at them.\\nI can look inside the tree.\\nThis is one.\\nWhen you cleave a plank out, you make it very strong because you follow the grain in the tree.\\nAnd that\\'s the problem with the saw, it would just cut straight.\\nSo it would cut all the fibers in the tree and that\\'s not only the planks, that\\'s also all the curved pieces.\\nYou have to go into the forest, find the right piece of curve.\\nYou\\'re not cutting over the fibers if you have the right shape of piece.\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s so important for boat builders if they find the right piece in the forest of an oak tree, you have to bring it home.\\nThe advantages of clinker build is that the two planks, when they overlap, then the overlap it\\'s kind of a strength itself.\\nIt\\'s not stiff, the result is flexibility.\\nAnd if you think like in your modern head, that you have to build strong and stiff, it will break when you\\'re going into sea.\\nThis means the boat won\\'t butt against the waves like a goat, but move over them like a ripple.\\nIt\\'s not as if we can experience exactly the same things as the Vikings did, but you get an idea.\\nAnd that is how we use experiments here at the museum, because you go out and you get an impression of what it is like being on board the ship, instead of, you know, sitting behind a desk and just reading about it.\\nWhen I was on board as a crew member\\nI functioned as a mid-ship man, which means I was located here in the middle of the ship, around the mast.\\nWhat I experienced there was that I tried to get an idea of the special conditions of being on board such a long and narrow ship as this is.\\nCrewed with 60 people.\\nThis is where you would have the helmsman, and you would have the skipper or the captain in that sense.\\nThe crew see\\'s it here, would work with the sheets, controlling the sheets of the sail.\\nIn front of the ship, the very front, you have the lookout.\\nWhich has a very important function on the ship.\\nHoist sails!\\nYou can imagine 60 people here in this very long and narrow ship.\\nAnd you would have a big square sail.\\nAnd you would have the elements out there when you\\'re sailing the ship.\\nThen it\\'s basically impossible for the lookout here to shout all the way to the aft of the ship.\\nJump ship!\\nAnd the way that it has been solved when we are sailing with the Sea Stallion, is that we have used a middle man.\\n<U+266A>\\nBy direct orders from the skipper and the helmsman, which need to be known by the whole crew.\\nSail down!\\nThe whole experience of being on board, being able to be a part of that crew...\\nHeave!\\n...trains you into becoming sort of a very coherent military unit.\\nSo, my theory is that being on board these ships could be seen as a training camp.\\nThe ships are shaping the crew.\\n(Shouting)\\nIt might be part of the success that the Viking has in the military of raiding, was basically that they were sailing on board these ships.\\nThis is a place of God!\\nViking raiders were very real and very bad indeed.\\nThere should be treasure.\\nBut that\\'s very much a tiny fraction of the whole picture.\\nProper Vikings, real Vikings they\\'re quite special people.\\nQuite unusual people.\\nNeil: So this is very much the top end of the scale, but, when you go down to the ordinary farmers building, it\\'s the same traditions of hospitality, and the importance of the hearth and the home, but just at a different scale.\\nTo friends and freedom!\\nThe characters break the mold of historical truths.\\nI like that sense of getting a character who clambers out of the coffin of historical necessity and starts to be real.\\nAnd starts to be plausible.\\nIt\\'s the way into the Viking mindset and the Viking world.\\nHail
